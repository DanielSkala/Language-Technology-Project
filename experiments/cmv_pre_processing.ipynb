What you do with it is what matters. It\\'s like anything else. You can use it to build or to destroy. You just have to make the choice.\"\\n\\nConstructive anger,\" the demon said, her voice dripping sarcasm. \\n\\nAlso known as passion,\" I said quietly. \"Passion has overthrown tyrants and freed prisoners and slaves. Passion has brought justice where there was savagery. Passion has created freedom where there was nothing but fear. Passion has helped souls rise from the ashes of their horrible lives and build something better, stronger, more beautiful.\"\\n\\nThink about people like Oskar Schindler and MLK. They saw great injustices and were angered by them. But instead of turning their anger outward and hurting people they turned it inward and used it as fuel to make the world a better place.',\n",

It is simply gorgeous and laid out well other than traffic wise, despite being there for only a short period of time, I could instantly tell that Toronto has shit traffic.

It feels dystopian with the streets littered from trash and refuse from the over populated city unable to cope with rubbish management. No really, its just unsightly to have the side walks filled with a pile of trash especially since this place is meant to represent the pinacle of civilisation. I actually believe that having that many tourists is a detracting factor. Definitely have some come through to represent something that is different but at a certain point, its just crowding and milling preventing you from enjoying your own city\\'s attractions.\\n\\nBroadway is of course amazing, the night life would be considerably better, but city wise new york city is a gimmick or a financial base.

It\\'s often described in the analogy of a house. No matter how pretty you make the walls and decor of the house (Weight or personal image, job, relationships, etc etc), if you built it on a cracked foundation, you haven\\'t really addressed the actual issue.\\n\\nSomewhere along the way, something impacted your Schema in a negative capacity. You need to get to that root cause and fix the foundation itself. Go to a psychologist, get someone who understands how to expose and explore the issues that are that embedded, and keep doing the other stuff you\\'re doing. Coping with depression as well as you have without altering the schema takes serious mental fortitude, and is quite commendable. ',\n",

And, at least before the end of MoP, the Forsaken were seen as monsters even within the Horde- let alone the Alliance. \\n\\nDoes that make it right that the Forsaken invaded Gilneas? No. But to the Forsaken, they're in a battle for their very survival as a race, not for the continued political existence of an organization. The Alliance could rise or fall- or even the Horde.

A first novel is exclusively the writer's project–they aren't being paid to write it, it can take as long as they want.

People are allowed to use their money or money that others donate to their cause to create political advertising to express their views. \\n\\n&gt; The second thing that should be done is to limit candidates from only accepting donations from the people in their district.\\n\\nWhile this is a good idea, it doesn't keep money out of politics - it just ensures that it's local money. In fact, I think this further distorts the democratic process. If my district is voting on new air quality regulations, the national Sierra Club can't donate to the fight, but the coal mine in town can. Guess which side is going to win. \\n\\n&gt; There should be an open ballot process. You file the paperwork to run and your name gets put on the ballot. \\n\\nAwesome: a ballot with 5000 candidates. I can't wait to vote for 'I.C. Weiner' and 'Seymore Butts'. There are enough wackos in politics today who *qualify* for the ballot: do we need to add more? In my state, there was a candidate who *qualified* for the ballot, who legally changed his name to 'Pro-Life' to attract anti-abortion voters. Did this guy have *any* legitimate political views, outside of his opposition to abortion? I think not. Qualifying for the ballot (at least in Idaho, apparently) is a piece of piss. In fact, with a ballot of 5000 candidates, do you know who will get the votes? The one who has done the most advertising, i.e. *the one with the most money*.

Whereas on competing platforms you may be stuck with a default app, practically everything on Android is an app, including the default ones, and can typically be replaced with something you love to use. That said, I find that the stock apps manage to weigh simplicity and functionality in the way I like, resulting in me not having to look for something else.\\n\\nThis openness also translates to social media. On Android, there's a system-wide sharing menu, that can be added to by the apps you use, so you can easily share things to the networks that *you* use. You can also use it to share to e-mail or whatever.\\n\\nWith Android, you're no longer stuck on a single phone manufacturer. If in X years time, you want to switch to the latest and greatest HTC or Sony or Motorola, you'll be able to retain apps, free and purchased ones. This increases competition among phone manufacturers, and allows you to move more easily in the future, with the least hassle.\\n\\nLastly, I love the small bits of functionality that Android enables.

Likewise, (reserve) military officers could form such a network, and indeed this happened in Switzerland up until the 80ies or even 90ies, where promotion on the job went hand in hand with promotion in the military (for leading positions).

In some industries, you\\'ll be looked down at if you were not in the military, while in the \"left\" culture and politics institutions, it carries a certain stigma to serve in the military - this is a lot weaker these days, but still exist to a minor degree)\\n\\nThird, if you have a society with different languages or even a wide country, there seems to be a tendency for language or region based troops. Swiss military is still widely organized among language lines below the officer levels. That means that most people will only do military service with people from the same area as them, defeating the purpose entirely.

If you set a minimum price that is above what something is worth, guess what? It won\\'t be bought. The foreign firms would leave, and workers would go back to subsistence farming and/or dying in the streets.\\n\\nAs for unions, you must distinguish between voluntary associations of workers and the government-backed cartels we have in the U.S. now. As it stands now, employers are *forced* to \"negotiate\" with unions. Unions can demand arbitrary wage increases and fringe benefits, and if the employers do not accept, they can be held to have negotiated \"in bad faith.\" In a free market, workers would be free to form unions, but the government would not recognize them or force employers to hold elections so that only one union can be represented. And if the union went on strike with unreasonable demands, the employer would be free to fire all of them and hire strikebreakers, if possible. If the workers were actually (profitably) irreplaceable, then the employer would be forced to negotiate, which is the legitimate purpose of unions.\\n\\nI would venture to say that *most* people in America hold the nonsense, Marxian idea that under laissez-faire, employers have the arbitrary power to reduce wages to subsistence levels. They \"exploit\" workers by taking up all the \"surplus value\", and we need the government to come in and force the employers to give back the surplus value by passing minimum wage, safety, and maximum-hours laws. In fact, this is not true. There is always more potential demand for labor than there is labor.

But since that is illegal, the second-best alternative (and the \"first-best\" in some industries) is outsourcing: since freedom of trade of legal but freedom of movement is not, you move the jobs to the workers instead of the workers to the jobs.\\n\\n&gt; I don\\'t disagree with the \"expand or die\" concept. That\\'s what a capitalist company is but it causes people to make sociopathic decisions that don\\'t consider the long term future, the environment, or other people. And so they need oversight from the public or government. But I digress...\\n\\nSo you are telling me you are *against* economic growth? In fact, this outsourcing to foreign countries and the economic growth it has provided has raised standards of living for both Americans and foreigners.\\n\\n&gt; These companies go to countries with +1 billion populations. You\\'re telling me the demand for labor is greater than labor in China or India? I\\'ll need some statistics to believe that.\\n\\nNo statistics are required. Just think: how much are you able to buy with the money you earn? Now, how much would you like to be able to buy with the money you earn? I imagine that it\\'s more. All of the additional goods and services that everyone would like to be able to buy require labor: more labor than is currently available. There is no limit to the amount of potential labor that people would like. Consider personal servants, if nothing else. Everyone would like to be able to have a personal chef or maid or chauffeur if he could afford it. But obviously, there is only, on average, one potential worker per person (and actually less, since some people don\\'t/can\\'t work).\\n\\n&gt; The question isn\\'t is it ethical to outsource jobs. What we should be asking is are these corporations doing it ethically? As long as there is poverty and inequality there will always be someone willing to work for less pay in unsafe conditions. These multinationals flock to places where people are the most desperate.\\n\\nOf course they flock to the places where people are most desperate: that is where the greatest opportunities for profit on both sides exist! If a company goes to some place where people earn $1 per day and pays them $5 per day, they can make a big profit, and the locals get to quintuple their living standards. And as this continues, these places become more developed, the productivity of labor increases, and so workers are able to earn more and more. This is *exactly* what has happened in China. They are not being \"exploited\": their living standards have improved incredibly since the 80s.',\n",

I do not think that current outsourcing is unethical.\\n\\nThe environmental issues are a smokescreen. The environmental issues China has are nothing in comparison to the gains it has made. If you want to point me to a specific case where an individual company is causing a direct and significant harm to someone else's property, then I am against that. But I do not support the incredibly overreaching laws that make it impossible to build new refineries in the U.S. Furthermore, it makes sense in a lot of cases for workers to take a dangerous job when it is better than what they could otherwise get. They should not be prevented from doing so.\\n\\nI also do not support police busting up protesters, so long as those protesters are not blocking off private property or disrupting operations. On the other hand, I do not think that it is necessarily wrong for a company to invest in a country with a less-than-perfect government.\",\n",

As a topic of conversation with regard to voter ID laws, it is irrelevant whether liberals are being self interested or not. If you do think it is relevant to the larger conversation, then I think that's a clear case of an Ad hominem attack plus a generalization about a whole group. \\n\\nParagraph 2) of all of the activities that you listed, only voting is a guaranteed right by the Constitution. I certainly don't like the fact that certain businesses need photo ID, but I don't have a constitutional right to do business there. In addition, there exists the concept of least harm. If a bank didn't require ID, it would be easy to steal someone's money. The ID requirement is less harmful than allowing people's money to be stolen. Conversely, the type of fraud that voter ID laws prevent essentially never occurs. Therefore, the least harm is to not have a voter ID law. \\n\\nParagraph 3) presupposes that liberal legislators don't already introduce legislation like this. They do, in fact, propose legislation like this, but once it is voted down by conservative legislators you probably won't hear about it. Moreover, it won't be reintroduced in that session, so it can only come up every few years.\\n\\nParagraph 4) presupposes that anyone cares what those communities want. It is, in fact, not about what those communities want and is instead about what the constitution guarantees those communities. Besides which, it is just as presumptuous for you to claim that you know what those communities want as for anyone else. \\n\\nI don't think that liberal outrage only goes as far as liberal self interest. If that were the case, you would see very few liberals upset about the death of Eric Garner, when in fact many are.

Had this been a true sexual harassment case I would fully support charges being pressed. \\n\\nAs for slapping someone in the face, unless defending your life or body from harm, violence is simply never ok. Tell me to stop, tell me you're uncomfortable, let me know in any polite or harsh manner you deem appropriate that I'm doing something wrong. But never hit anyone just because they make you uncomfortable. If they touch you it is of course appropriate to use force, if necessary, to remove them. But in this case the boy had already ended the kiss and there was no need for force to stop him doing what was already over. If he leaned in for another kiss I could understand a slap. But considering, again, the circumstances, I would hope a fairly light warning slap and not an actual attempt to hurt the kid. \\n\\nAgain, self defense is always ok, in my opinion, but using violence either as revenge or even a deterrent doesn't sit right with me. Especially for an isolated incident like this. More communication generally leads to fewer problems and misunderstandings. \",\n",

My position has remained EXTREMELY consistent:\\nThe term \"sexual harassment\" should not apply in this case.  A single incident does not raise to the level of harassment.

       "   'OK, because this has gotten a bit out of hand, I want to make this clear: I agree with you that this *may not* fall under the definition of sexual harassment. My original point was addressing your assertion that harassment requires multiple instances, which is why I cited a piece of legislation that states the opposite. About the goalposts comment, I apologise for that; I mixed you up with the guy above whose comments were deleted, and I should have checked the usernames more clearly.\\n\\nHere\\'s my reasoning. Labour legislation probably applies to her if she\\'s a paid RA. If she\\'s an employee, she has the right to a workplace free of sexual harassment. This incident falls under those guidelines: she\\'s had someone make contact with her of a sexual nature that she found offensive. The [Ontario Human Rights Commission](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/sexual-harassment-employment-fact-sheet) notes that \"[i]n some cases, one incident could be serious enough to be sexual harassment.\"  This may not be serious enough to fall under that definition, but given that he\\'s contacted her again, it might not count as a single incident.\\n\\n&gt;The boy was not her employer.\\n\\nAgain, this is immaterial. Workplace harassment does not have to come from her employers or even her co-workers (see [here](http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/wvps_guide/guide_7.php), which explicitly lists students as a source of workplace harassment). The conduct occurred in her workplace, and it is obviously linked to her work as an RA. That he is a student and not her boss does not matter.\\n\\n&gt;His action was not of a graphic sexual nature\\n\\nHis comments don\\'t have to include anything explicitly sexual: the Ontario Human Rights Commission includes a bunch of examples in the link I provided above, including repeatedly asking for dates or making unnecessary physical contact. If he\\'s stopped expressing interest in her, that\\'s great! If he still is, or if he starts up again, it could constitute sexual harassment according to the Human Rights Code and Labour Code.\\n\\n&gt;even your side of the debate would have to agree that a kiss on the cheek is not something that rises to the level of sexual assault.\\n\\nI stated above that it can, and I\\'m right. Statscan includes it in their sexual assault survey [here](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.htm.).  A [criminal law firm in Toronto](http://www.torontocriminallawyers.com/criminal-charges/sexual-assault) states explicitly that it can lead to charges:\\n\\n&gt;While the gravest of cases of sexual assault, like those involving rape or child molestation are given more coverage in the media, sexual assault can be charged for unwanted kissing, groping, or other activity that may be not be commonly thought of as sexual assault.\\n\\nSo yes, while it isn\\'t as horrific as rape, unwanted kissing can constitute sexual assault. Maybe you think this shouldn\\'t be the case, but it is. She expressed to him that a kiss would be unwanted; he tried it anyway. This was sexual contact to which she did not consent. I\\'m not sure how this can be any more clear.\\n\\n&gt;Says you. You can\\'t know their intent.\\n\\nYou\\'re quite right. If their intent was to kiss the child sexually, then this constitutes sexual assault. Actually, even if they didn\\'t intend it sexually, it *could* still be sexual assault, as set out in R. v. Chase:\\n\\n&gt;\"Viewed in the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual \\nor carnal context of the assault visible to a reasonable observer\"\\n\\nBased on that, given the boy\\'s attempt to kiss her right after asking about a boyfriend and asking if she would like him to kiss her, a reasonable observer would likely conclude that the kiss had a sexual context. A grandmother kissing her grandkid on the cheek probably wouldn\\'t meet the test.\\n\\n&gt;You are now arguing that the word \"employee\" only matters when referring to the victim, if this girl and this boy had the exact same situation happen but she was unemployeed, then by your reasoning it would NOT have been sexual harassment since she didn\\'t have a job.\\n\\nPrecisely. The definition of sexual harassment that I\\'ve provided is based on her employment context, not his. If she were unemployed, this would simply be sexual assault, not sexual harassment. As far as I know, there is no Canadian criminal offence of sexual harassment. She asked about sexual harassment in her workplace, however, and that is definitely proscribed.\\n\\n&gt;Sexual Harassment guidelines were drawn up because there were problems IN THE WORK PLACE.\\n\\nAgain, if she is an RA, employed by the school, this *is* her workplace. Sexual harassment laws apply to her. It doesn\\'t matter whether or not you think this is a massive overreach, because it\\'s pretty clear that she was subject to unwanted sexual contact in her workplace, and she has a right to be free of that.\\n\\nThis took quite a while to type up, so I apologise if it\\'s fragmented in any way. Please let me know if you need clarification. IANAL, this is not legal advice, and this might all be pointless since she\\'s probably not subject to Ontario law anyway.',\n",
       "   '&gt; If she\\'s an employee, she has the right to a workplace free of sexual harassment.\\n\\nOnly in so far as such harassment is being carried out by other employees or is happening repeatedly.  To say that this event applies is to say that she should have the right to sue her employer for this violation.\\n\\nThis is not her being forced to be exposed to a known problem, nor is it a hostile work environment.   During the course of her work she came in contact with a non-employee and had an unfortunate exchange with him.\\n\\nIf I worked for the cable company and went to someone\\'s house to install cable and that person was in their underwear, I can\\'t ask the cable company to fire that non-employee for sexual harassment.  I can\\'t sure the cable company for sending me to the house.\\n\\nIt would only rise to the level of a hostile work environment if I was repeatedly instructed to go back there by people who knew what would happen to me there.\\n\\nSimilarly a hostile work environment is not a single guy telling a single dirty joke.  It\\'s a series of events from one or more people.   Harassment needs to rise to a higher level and be more persistent than a single kiss on the cheek by a 15 yr old boy.\\n\\n&gt;Again, this is immaterial. Workplace harassment does not have to come from her employers or even her co-workers (see here, which explicitly lists students as a source of workplace harassment).\\n\\nExcept he\\'s not her student.  Unless you are arguing that this document implies that students are categorically offensive which seems like a stretch.\\n\\nThat same document states: The Occupational Health and Safety Act defines workplace harassment as \"engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct against a worker in a workplace that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome.\"\\n\\nA _course_ of vexatious...  in other words, not a single instance but a pattern of behavior.\\n\\n&gt; His comments don\\'t have to include anything explicitly sexual: the Ontario Human Rights Commission includes a bunch of examples in the link I provided above, including repeatedly asking for dates or making unnecessary physical contact. If he\\'s stopped expressing interest in her, that\\'s great! If he still is, or if he starts up again, it could constitute sexual harassment according to the Human Rights Code and Labour Code.\\n\\nIF he _starts up again_.   \"Repeatedly\" asking for dates.   Are you seeing the pattern here?   In order for it to be harassment, he has to HARASS her which requires more than a single event.\\n\\nOtherwise, any time any student asks anyone who has a job out, it\\'s sexual harassment.  That\\'s clearly not the intent of the law.\\n\\n&gt; sexual assault can be charged for unwanted kissing\\n\\nAgain, this situation is not what they are talking about.  The law was not designed to punish 15 yr old boys who kiss a single girl on the cheek a single time.  That\\'s not sexual harassment and to suggest otherwise is a massive overreach.\\n\\nWhen you overreach with a law, the law becomes meaningless.  If everyone is guilty of sexual harassment every time they interact with everyone else, then fuck it, grab some boobies!\\n\\n&gt; Precisely. The definition of sexual harassment that I\\'ve provided is based on her employment context, not his. If she were unemployed, this would simply be sexual assault, not sexual harassment. As far as I know, there is no Canadian criminal offence of sexual harassment. She asked about sexual harassment in her workplace, however, and that is definitely proscribed.\\n\\nSorry but that is clearly outside the scope of what this law is intended to prevent.  No reasonable person could hold an employer responsible for every single event that occurs to their employees.\\n\\nIf I walk into a donut shop and ask out the girl behind the counter, she can\\'t sure Donuts Inc. for failing to protect her from my asking her out one time.   That\\'s insane.\\n\\n&gt; she was subject to unwanted sexual contact in her workplace, and she has a right to be free of that.\\n\\nAnd how _EXACTLY_ do you expect the employer to be able to prevent every potential event involving non-employees from occurring?  They can\\'t.  They can\\'t be expected to.\\n\\nWhat you CAN ask them to do is recognize a pattern and provide relief from that pattern.   If this boy were to continue doing this, then she could ask that he or she be moved, or that someone in charge talk to him about it.   But that can only occur in the case of _harassment_ which requires that something happen more than once.\\n\\nIf this boy never does this again, then what exactly is the school supposed to have done?

Children are insulated from the world by their parents. They won't feel the impact of taxes, because they don't have jobs or buy things.

The only person *really* impacted is the guardian, and they already have a vote.\\n\\n&gt; To clarify, my practical view of an implementation of this is that a responsible guardian would vote on behalf of the child until such a point as the guardian feels the child is suitably mature to make their own decision or the child has reached a certain age.\\n\\nThe big problem with this is that you are giving the guardian multiple votes with no guarantee they will consult their child.

The manager can try to foster that environment, but ultimately its up to the players and the leaders in the dressing room to make it happen. \\n\\n2.

He was our second best player coming out of the previous campaign and was in a great position to continue being a dominant playmaker, massive blow to lose him. \\n\\n3.

Tesla also plans to set up the first network of electric car recharge stations across the USA as well as eventually create cheap electric cars which are targeted toward the average consumer. This is revolutionary thinking.\\n\\nWith all these things in mind, you really cannot argue that Steve Jobs was a better entrepreneur, innovator or revolutionary. Steve Jobs focused on creating mass popular consumer goods, focused on creating a corporate empire which completely disregarded any form of true philanthropy which is in stark contrast to almost all other tech giants, including the philanthropic, pro-science contributions of Elon Musk.\\n\\nI really cannot think of many great things Steve Jobs actually achieved other than funding Pixar and creating a lot of popular shiny products.',\n",

But still, take this with a grain of salt.\\n\\nThe word that your translation is translating as \"pure\" would be better translated as \"tested\", implying that you can, in a sense, test anything that claims to be divinely inspired scripture to see if it is or not. I\\'m not going to get into what that testing is because there isn\\'t a definitive answer (That\\'s why Catholics have their cannon which is different to the Protestant Cannon, which is different from the Orthodox Cannon). But the point is that if something passes the test, it is scripture, and if it is scripture there is no problem with it being included.\\n\\n\\n Proverbs 30:6 is a clear reference back to Deuteronomy 4:2 \"You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.\"\\n  In this passage Moses is relaying messages from God to the Israelites. Notice how the commandment is \"do not add or take away from it\". God here is not stating that you should never state your opinion or refrain from discussion because doing so would not be adding or taking away from scripture. You would only be adding or taking away if you were claiming that your opinion was divinely inspired, or claiming that your edited version of a verse was divinely inspired on the same level as the Bible.\\n\\nYou probably noticed that I always used the phrase \"divinely inspired\" instead of something along the lines of \"the word of God.\" as it is never claimed that scripture is a direct copy of God\\'s words, but that God instead inspired the authors of scripture to use their own words to convey his message(As opposed to the Quoran, which is believed by musilms to be God\\'s own words that Muhammad purely wrote down). If you go to Paul\\'s second letter to Timothy, chapter 3, verse 16 you\\'ll read something along the lines of \"All scripture is inspired by God\" or \"all scripture is God-breathed.\" The word that is translated as \"God-breathed\" or \"inspired by God\" is [\"theopneustos\"](http://biblesuite.com/greek/2315.htm) and that is the only time it is used in the Bible. As a matter of fact, it is the first record we have of that word in all of Greek literature. As well as making an important theological note on the nature of scripture itself, it also makes it clear that the teachings of Christ are not meant in any way to alter the teachings of the Old testament, but merely to make it more clear as to the old testament meant in the first place and to provide a path of atonement that wasn\\'t impossible for sinful, imperfect humanity to follow- as was the way of the Jews, who had to pay for their inability to follow the law to a T with (animal/monetary) sacrifice.\\n\\nThe reason that we can know that Paul was referring to, or at the very least including, the Old Testament when he uses the word \"scripture\" is pretty simple. At the time of writing his epistles, the \"New Testament\" as canonical scripture didn\\'t exist. Paul didn\\'t know that this letter to Timothy would later be considered scripture. The only scripture out there at the time of writing was the Old Testament (Christians of the time primarily used the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint), a greek translation of the Hebrew bible). The first record we have of an attempt to collect specificially \"Christian\" scripture isn\\'t until about 140 AD (The canon of the New Testament, 1997, Oxford University Press, page 98) and it isn\\'t until the 3rd century AD until there is some semblance of a consensus among Christendom as to the content of the New Testament (A Summary of Christian History, 1959, Broadman Press, page 41)\\n\\nI guess what I was trying to say is that \\n\\n1) it\\'s okay to talk about the Bible without fear of breaking the command in Prov 30:6 as long as you\\'re not claiming to be authoritative and without possibility of error. \\n\\n2) Assuming you are a Bible-believing Christian, you are accepting the Bible on a whole, not differentiating between the OT and NT in terms of what is scripture and what isn\\'t. To do so would be the same as thinking every OT book written after Proverbs wasn\\'t scripture just because it wasn\\'t written before Solomon (they\\'re pretty sure it was him) wrote Proverbs.\\n\\n3) It\\'s your job as a Christian that when you\\'re presented with something that claims to be scripture to evaluate it alongside of the Bible to determine the validity of that work\\'s claim.\\n\\n4) Talk to your Pastor, church theologian (if you have one), a church deacon, or someone else in the church that you trust about concerns like this.

There is no \"g\".\\n\\nThe reason why the standard IQ test is both imperfect and also gives the appearance of adequately testing intelligence is similar to the reason why gigahertz can give you an idea of the performance of a computer, but has slipped further out of favor while having no scientifically reliable substitutes to take its place. \\n\\n We created computers, so we understand why the clock speed is no longer important. And we understand them at a level that we don\\'t yet have for the brain. Thanks to environmental factors (or markets, if you prefer) we began focusing with ever greater urgency on issues that didn\\'t matter in the megahertz era such as power consumption, specialized applications for decompressing audio and video, throwing triangles into video buffers, or moving large chunks of memory from one address to another.\\n\\n What evolution does to us is similar to what we do to circuits, and what genetics does with us is still beyond our system of patents and copyrights. We [mix genes like bonkers](http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2012/03/31/beautiful-black-and-white-twins-kian-and-remee-hodgson-turn-seven/), so as time goes on it\\'s harder and harder to fix any particular attribute to any particular race.

It\\'s getting nigh impossible to fit anyone into a category which we could draw conclusions from.\\n\\n You said that \"Africans are genetically inclined towards lower intelligence higher rates of violence\" and I\\'ll propose why: complex proteins such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and the skin pigment melanin share a common pathway. Such was revealed by Dimitry Belyaev when he set up an experiment to tame Siberian foxes. He selected pups for breeding the next generation according to which had the shortest flight distance, and within remarkably few generations he had tame foxes, but they also had [splotchy fur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox).\\n\\n If you know a bit about cooking, think of [roux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux). It\\'s the \"mother sauce\", or foundation for dozens of other sauces, so if you change the recipe for roux you change the outcome for everything based on it. Adrenaline and melanin share the same \"roux\", and Dimitry\\'s foxes solved their domestication problem by altering the recipe for it, hence their fur color changed at the same time. This is possibly the reason why blacks have a different disposition to whites: they\\'re not less intelligent, they just have a richer sauce for a hormone unrelated to intelligence.\\n\\n The density of neurons isn\\'t a major factor for a good reason: the human brain isn\\'t a blob of computing material, it\\'s a box of gadgets. Punch out the fusiform gyrus and you get prosopagnosia; grow a lesion on Broca\\'s area and you get aphasia. Add more prefrontal cortex and you get greater discretion, [destroy it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage) and you get less.\\n\\n But the practical nature of the amorphous concept we call intelligence is not something you can turn up and down like a genetic thermostat.

Talk of \"stimulus generalization\" in such a case simply perpetuates the mystery under a new title. These abilities indicate that there must be fundamental processes at work quite independently of \"feedback\" from the environment. I have been able to find no support whatsoever for the doctrine of Skinner and others that slow and careful shaping of verbal behavior through differential reinforcement is an absolute necessity. If reinforcement theory really requires the assumption that there be such meticulous care, it seems best to regard this simply as a reductio ad absurdum argument against this approach. (Chomsky, 1967)  \\n\\n&gt;To say that the origin of self-control is not in the self is not to say that the organism has no properties or has been subtracted out of consideration. The biological properties of the organism determine which environmental events control which behavioral events. What has been subtracted out are those psychological (as opposed to\\nbiological) properties of the organism such as memory, expectancy, response strength, etc. which serve only to bridge temporal gaps. .. . If a man is stabbed and he\\nbleeds, no one will be tempted to talk about memory of the stabbing and response strength of the bleeding intervening between stabbing and bleeding, although the properties of his body determined that he would bleed when stabbed. But for temporally extended events such as his dissatisfaction with a bad job, traditional psychological analysis will invoke memory, expectancy and response strength in order to bring the cause and effect into immediate temporal proximity. It is certainly something about the man that reacts to the long hours, the low pay, the hostile boss, etc., by complaining, going on strike or quitting. But it is nevertheless these temporally extended events that cause his behavior and not his immediate memories, expectations, and response strengths. (Howard Rachlin, 1974)\\n\\n&gt;Behaviorism succeeded brilliantly insofar as it argued for a new emphasis on behavior, both as goal and as method, but in reacting to the limitations of introspection it went too far in rejecting it totally. Introspection is limited in what it can achieve, but an acknowledgment of its limitations does not thereby require its total proscription. This rigid rejection may initially have been the only way in which a new generation of psychologists could be shielded from the siren call of mentalism, but in their efforts to avoid the difficulties posed by introspection, the early behaviorists may also have ignored the advantages to be gained. (David Lieberman, 1979)  \\n\\n&gt;\"Because so little is known about the central nervous system, it serves as the last refuge of the soul in psychology.” (G.E. Zuriff, 1985)  \\n\\n&gt;\"Dismissing mental states and processes, [radical behaviorism] directs attention to the … history of the individual and to the current environment where the real causes of behavior are to be found.” (Skinner, 1987)  \\n\\n&gt;“If the proper attention is paid to the variables controlling behavior and an appropriate behavioral unit is chosen, orderliness appears directly in the behavior and the postulated theoretical processes become superfluous.” (Zuriff, 1988)  \\n\\n',\n",
       "   '&gt;What you\\'re missing is that physical science and linguistics/langauge analysis (including analytic psychology) are two entirely different epistemic approaches that define reality and truth in different ways. Neither is better or worse, and more importantly neither can simply replace the other, the way that Watson and Skinner believed.\\n\\nI\\'m not missing that point, I\\'m agreeing with it - as Skinner and Watson did also. They only commented on the empirical and scientific approach to behavior and the mind; anything else is irrelevant to them. Importantly, they did not dismiss their usefulness.\\n\\n&gt;I don\\'t mean this to sound insulting, but it\\'s exhausting and pointless to argue with someone who simply denies, defines away or refutes by assertion every point I make.\\n\\nI haven\\'t argued by assertion though, I\\'ve explained the history of the field. Look, the problem here is that I\\'m a radical behaviorist and professional psychologist - I\\'ve spent years studying the area (with a particular interest in the history of behaviorism), I\\'ve spent years working in the field, I\\'ve worked with other behaviorists, I\\'ve attended conferences dedicated to behaviorist approaches, etc. The problem is that what you\\'re describing as behaviorism is unlike anything I have ever seen from a behaviorist source.\\n\\n&gt;So if you can bring any actual evidence, information, links, etc. to the support your points, that\\'s fine, but otherwise this is a waste of both our time. Meanwhile...\\n\\nSure, let\\'s see what quotes you have and I\\'ll explain why they\\'re wrong.\\n\\n&gt;\"Psychology may be, at least in part, as independent of introspection as physics.” (Edward Thorndike, 1911)\\n\\nInteresting quote and I could try explaining how it works in context, but Thorndike wasn\\'t a behaviorist so it\\'s irrelevant to this discussion. He was a connectionist and whilst he inspired some work of behavioral psychologists, he is not a behaviorist.\\n\\n&gt;Psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. (John B. Watson, 1913).\\n\\nLet\\'s note that Watson proposed methodological behaviorism. The relevance of this is twofold: 1) it\\'s hugely outdated and didn\\'t even last two decades, 2) methodological behaviorism is defined as the suggestion that we should ignore inner mental states.\\n\\nThe second point is the most important as of course a methodological behaviorist is going to suggest that, whilst doing science and using empirical methods, the use of introspective methods aren\\'t going to be overly useful. As Watson explains in the rest of his essay, this doesn\\'t mean that introspection is absolutely useless, just in the matters of the empirical - which you agree with.\\n\\n&gt;The problem with inner processes \"“is not that they do not exist, but that they are not relevant.” (Skinner, 1957)\\n\\nThis is severely taking Skinner out of context, especially since the sentence has been changed and cut off too early. Here\\'s what he actually said: \"The objection to inner states is not that they do not exist, \\nbut that they are not relevant in a functional analysis\".\\n\\nHis argument is a metascientific argument about the control and prediction of behavior. That is, since cognitions cannot be independent variables (i.e. we can directly insert a thought into someone\\'s head), we have to manipulate these variables indirectly and thus take a step back in the causal chain. \\n\\nOf course he believed cognitions were important to understand in the study of behavioral and cognitive processes though, he dedicated basically half a book to the topic in every book he wrote.\\n\\nI recommend you read O\\'Donohue\\'s \"[Skinner on Cognitions](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02110476)\".\\n\\n&gt;(Chomsky, 1967)\\n\\nThis is an attack on stimulus-response psychology and so has no relevance to Skinner\\'s arguments or radical behaviorism. You can read about how badly Chomsky messed up when trying to criticise Verbal Behavior here: [On Chomsky\\'s Review of Skinner\\'s Verbal Behavior](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1333660/). \\n\\n&gt;(Howard Rachlin, 1974)\\n\\nI\\'m not entirely sure why you\\'ve quoted Rachlin there - his entire argument is that even though extended environmental events affect self-control, internal events are still important to the development of the behavior. It\\'s doubly strange given that Rachlin is the originator of telelogical behaviorism, an approach to behaviorism which explicitly integrates cognitive concepts into behaviorism..\\n\\n&gt;This rigid rejection may initially have been the only way in which a new generation of psychologists could be shielded from the siren call of mentalism, but in their efforts to avoid the difficulties posed by introspection, the early behaviorists may also have ignored the advantages to be gained. (David Lieberman, 1979)\\n\\nLieberman is only discussing methodological behaviorists there who rejected introspection because they rejected inner states as a scientific topic. I assume he\\'s not referring to Skinner, [who explicitly states that radical behaviorism is partly defined in its rejection of methodological behaviorism refusal to accept introspective methods](http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/BFSkinnerphil1.pdf):\\n\\n&gt;The statement that behaviorists deny the existence of feelings, sensations, \\nideas, and other features of mental life needs a good deal of clarification. \\nMethodological behaviorism and some versions of logical positivism ruled private events out of bounds because there could be no public agreement about their \\nvalidity. Introspection could not be accepted as a scientific practice, and the \\npsychology of people like Wilhelm Wundt and Edward B. Titchener was attacked \\naccordingly. Radical behaviorism, however, takes a different line. It does not \\ndeny the possibility of self-observation or self-knowledge or its possible \\nusefulness, but it questions the nature of what is felt or observed and hence \\nknown. It restores introspection but not what philosophers and introspective \\npsychologists had believed they were \"specting,\"\\n\\nThis is hard to reconcile with the idea that radical behaviorists reject introspection.\\n\\n&gt;\"Because so little is known about the central nervous system, it serves as the last refuge of the soul in psychology.” (G.E. Zuriff, 1985)\\n\\nI don\\'t know who Zuriff is so you\\'d need to quote some more of his argument there so I can see where he\\'s coming from, but he\\'s flatly contradicting Skinner and the radical behaviorists who viewed the physiological processes of the brain as integral to the study of behavior (assuming the quote is an accurate representation of his position). That is, you cannot separate radical behaviorism from the discussion of private events, and especially Skinner\\'s understanding of phylogenetic behaviors. For example:\\n\\n&gt;“Valid facts about behavior are not\\ninvalidated by discoveries concerning the nervous\\nsystem, nor are facts about the nervous system\\ninvalidated by facts about behavior. Both sets of\\nfacts are part of the same enterprise, and I have always\\nlooked forward to the time when neurology\\nwould fill in the temporal and spatial gaps which\\nare inevitable in a behavioral analysis” (Skinner,\\n1988b, p. 128, and see also pp. 461, 470).\\n\\nSuggesting that Skinner rejected the importance of physiology is not supported by anything he\\'s ever said or written.\\n\\n&gt;\"Dismissing mental states and processes, [radical behaviorism] directs attention to the … history of the individual and to the current environment where the real causes of behavior are to be found.” (Skinner, 1987)\\n\\nI can\\'t find a source for any of this quote, and the IEP you took these quotes from doesn\\'t give a source either. With what little I have to work with, again I\\'d suggest this is a misunderstanding of Skinner\\'s position on the role of cognition in functional analyses.\\n\\n&gt;“If the proper attention is paid to the variables controlling behavior and an appropriate behavioral unit is chosen, orderliness appears directly in the behavior and the postulated theoretical processes become superfluous.” (Zuriff, 1988)\\n\\nThis includes cognition - cognitions are behaviors in radical behaviorism. Not behaviors as in physical external behaviors, but things done by the organism. They are variables that determine other behaviors. \\n\\nYou might enjoy reading some of these papers that discuss in detail the myths and misconceptions that are popularly held about behaviorism:\\n\\n[On misconceptions about behavior analysis among university students and teachers.](http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=tpr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.nz%2Fscholar%3Fq%3Dmisconceptions%2Bof%2Bskinner%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%26as_vis%3D1%26oi%3Dscholart%26sa%3DX%26ei%3DpwWvUMrZI66QiAe5xIHIBQ%26ved%3D0CCgQgQMwAA#search=%22misconceptions%20skinner%22)\\n\\n[Misconception and Miseducation:\\nPresentations of Radical Behaviorism in\\nPsychology Textbooks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741965/pdf/behavan00069-0037.pdf)\\n\\nAnd there are some good videos contrasting the descriptions of Skinner\\'s positions with Skinner\\'s own words here:\\n\\n[Sapolsky and Skinner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Tq_ijscWQ)\\n\\n[Chomsky and Skinner.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlyU_M20hMk)\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "   'Wow, I didn\\'t expect such a thorough reply to my complaint about lack of references. I thank you, and I enjoyed looking through these articles. Among other things I learned, your links &amp; discussions helped me figure out some areas where we\\'re using terminology differently and so talking past each other.  \\n\\nProbably the most important problem, and it\\'s my fault, is that way back in my original reply to OP I used the word \"behaviorism\" as an umbrella term. The way I meant the term is quite different from the way you mean it. I was using \"behaviorism\" as a basket in which to put nearly all strict empirical approaches to psychology, including Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, but also logical positivism, etc. Essentially all I meant by \"behaviorism\" was \"empirical science as applied to psychology &amp; language.\" I was responding to CMV, *defending* psychology (by which I took OP to mean primarily analytic &amp; perhaps cognitive approaches to psychology) as a practice not by claiming that it is a hard science but by distinguishing it from physical science as a valid endeavor more akin to philosophy or logic. You obviously, as a professional in the field, have a far more rigorous definition of the term than I intended, and indeed \"behaviorism\" to you includes a number of different subfields, some contradictory. As MacCorquodale notes in his rebuttal to Chomsky:  \\n\\n&gt;Because not all S-R psychologists are sympathetic to Skinner\\'s version many of them felt themselves out of Chomsky\\'s range and were not moved to defend themselves or Skinner. This is somewhat ingenuous of them, however, since Chomsky\\'s actual target is only about one-half Skinner, with the rest a mixture of odds and ends of other behaviorisms and some other fancies of vague origin. No behaviorist escaped untouched. On the other hand, most Skinnerians correctly concluded that *their* behaviorism was not particularly the focus of the review...\\n\\nSo there are many behaviorisms, and the layman\\'s impression of behaviorism is influenced by all of them whereas a professional\\'s definition excludes much that has been rejected either by the field as a whole or by his/her subfield. I think as a result we\\'ve gotten bogged down in a \"true Scotsman\" argument about what behaviorism really is or isn\\'t, when I never intended to get into a survey of the field and its development. A lot of your rebuttals to the quotes I provided amount to variations on a) \"that isn\\'t behaviorism any*more*\" or b) \"that person isn\\'t a behaviorist.\" But we\\'re talking past each other since I meant only to describe empirical approaches to psychology in general, and you are defending the specific, current prevailing subfield of behaviorism that has distanced itself from a logical-positivist style rejection of many mental phenomena.\\n\\nSuffice to say that all I intended by invoking \"behaviorism\" was to draw a very broad distinction between empirical, and analytic/linguistic approaches to psychology, pointing out that the analytic/linguistic approach has advantages that empirical science by definition cannot reproduce (although it can certainly illuminate understanding from within its own domain, including offering highly successful therapeutic and investigative approaches). That is really all I\\'ve been trying to say, and your own links more or less back up my point in language that you might find more convincing than my layman\\'s generalizations. MacCorquodale again:\\n\\n&gt;The fact is simply that we do not yet know if verbal behavior is within the domain of Skinner\\'s system and whether the technical terms stimulus, response, reinforcement are literally applicable to verbal behavior and correctly parse it into its functional parts of speech.  \\n\\nIn pointing out that Skinner\\'s approach in *Verbal Behavior* amounts to an untested hypothesis, he reinforces at least part of the point I\\'ve been making that empirical psychology is at a disadvantage when it comes to the analysis of mental phenomena. I\\'ve been using \"introspection\" as another basket term to include a lot of things many specialists in different fields wouldn\\'t consider introspective, including language itself. Granted there are empirical aspects to the study of language, in that we can build machines that can parse observed grammar on their own, we can study animal communication without introspective access to its rules and phenomenal aspects, etc. But fundamentally linguistics involves making phenomenal judgments (above all judgments like \"expression X is meaningful\" or \"is not meaningful\" or \"corresponds to semantic cluster Y or syntactic rule Z\", etc.). An observer making these kinds of judgments is by definition unable to point to empirical observations, which explains why Skinner\\'s approach to understanding language \"from the outside\" encounters a number of methodological hurdles and encumbrances that a linguist merely tracing the logic of language internally *as they understand it as a language user* can simply avoid. This amounts to no more than saying that introspective experience is not reducible to empirical observation, but exists in addition to it as a distinct field of experience.  \\n\\nSkinner reinforces this point when he suggests that what he calls a \"functional analysis\" of language...or any mental process...in no way requires a detailed introspective understanding of the internal structure or perceived experience of that process:    \\n\\n&gt; Our increasing knowledge of the control exerted by the environment makes it possible to examine the effect of the world within the skin and the nature of self-knowledge. It also makes it possible to interpret a wide range of mentalistic expressions. For example, we can look at those features of behavior which have led people to speak of an act of will, of a sense of purpose, of experience as distinct from reality, of innate or acquired ideas, of memories, meanings, and the personal knowledge of the scientist, and of hundreds of other mentalistic things or events. Some can be \"translated into behavior,\" others discarded as unnecessary or meaningless.   \\n\\nIn other words, Skinner is pretty clearly rejecting a \"mentalist\" picture of what he seems to regard as a dualist fallacy in that mental events and structures themselves cause behavior. But he\\'s also rejecting the notion that the structure of mental processes can do more than simply mediate environmental forces. Compare Freud\\'s dictum that \"there are no meaningless thoughts.\" Skinner\\'s pretty clear that his approach rejects introspective experience insofar as that experience can\\'t be related to the environmental-behavioral axis. MacCorquodale makes the principle even more explicit.  \\n\\n&gt;It is perfectly feasible and sufficient to know merely that the speaker\\'s \"internal structure. .. processes information\" so as to generate lawful relations between the speaker\\'s circumstances (past and present) and his speech. Unless one is a neurophysiologist it is not necessary in the least to know how the internal structure goes about doing so nor which structures are involved. The psychologist\\'s knowing how it does so would not improve the precision of predicting behavior from knowledge of the speaker\\'s circumstances, nor would this knowledge make existing functional laws of behavior any more true, nor could it show them to be untrue. It is simply false, of course, that one cannot accurately predict behavior, even complex behavior, without knowing and taking into account the behaver\\'s structure and internal processes; we do it all the time. In point of fact, our current knowledge of the functional laws of behavior far precedes and outweighs both our knowledge of, and even our theories about, the mediating mechanisms involved. For example, so far as I can tell, the behavioral facts of reinforcement are by now so well known and dependable that theories of the details of its mediation are no longer of great interest. Where interest in the mediating structures survives, it is behavioral data which illuminate them, not the other way around.  \\n\\nAll of which, as far as I can tell, reinforces my claim that empirical psychology pretty much has to reject introspective experience as a field for experiment. Obviously it can record introspective reports, from simple ones like \"I want a cheeseburger\" to Chomsky\\'s elaborate theory of generative grammar, but it can\\'t really \"do\" anything with those reports until if and when it is able to correlate them with observed, measurable stimuli and behavior. Behaviorism\\'s field for experiment is still very much the lab, the clinic, the survey, etc., and it can make progress with introspective experience *if and only if* that experience can be linked to observable data. The non-behavioral psychologist (or linguist) obviously doesn\\'t have this self-imposed limitation. He or she therefore gets access to formalist, rationalist analysis of internal experience which can be relatively rigorous, but the tradeoff is that correlation with physical observation is not always available. Hence my original point that \"psychology\" is a valuable field that can be rigorous and productive whether or not it is grounded in empirical observation.  \\n\\nI don\\'t see anything so far in your links which suggests my basic picture is wrong... if you\\'re aware of radical behavioral experiments or studies that primarily employ what I\\'m calling introspection (i.e. phenomenal as opposed to empirical experience) as an experimental methodology, I\\'d be happy to read some more and see if I can figure out what I\\'m missing. I\\'m going to cling to my idea that internal observation and analysis of phenomenal experience and \"mediating structures\" remains valuable as a separate field of inquiry from empirical scientific observation though. :)  \\n\\nP.S. -- I noticed that my original reply to OP could have been taken as somewhat hostile to behaviorism or even empirical science in general, which wasn\\'t my intent. My intent was only to take the OP\\'s unstated assumption (empirical fields alone are valid as scientific endeavors) and then make an orthogonal point that non-empirical fields can be both rigorous and useful, notwithstanding decades of interdepartmental attacks from the \"hard\" sciences.',\n",

You have to be not only conversant with the rules of syntax, phonetics, morphology, semantics, grammar, etc., you have to be able to bend those rules or invent combinations or entirely new rules on the fly in meaningful ways. The phrase \"in meaningful ways\" marks the key epistemic difference between the normative/participatory nature of language vs. descriptivist nature of physical science. Science tests to see whether something is true; language must test to see whether something *is meaningful*. And only a language user can determine whether something is meaningful or not. A language *observer* can guess at best, and then only if constantly chaperoned by language users who alone can provide confirmation of those guesses (this is how Active Learning works).  \\n\\nTo give another example, imagine a computer discovers a brand new written language. Olmec tablets similar to the Mayan hieroglyphs but with completely different glyphs describing a completely different language. Or maybe a proto-Sumerian language created before Cuneiform was invented. I think we can both agree that a present-day computer given a highly sophisticated set of analytic tools might well be able to crack the language and decipher the texts, and do it faster, or even way faster than a team of trained paleographers. But there would be two problems.  \\n\\nA) the computer would never be able to tell if it had the \"correct\" answer or not -- in fact it would be utterly reliant on trained paleographers to verify its work. This is true even if the computer is constructed using advanced Active Learning algorithms...at the end of the day, the computer is utterly reliant on human language users to confirm whether a given interpretation is \"meaningful.\" Again, only language users are able to make the judgment as to whether something is or is not meaningful.  \\n\\nB) Even human interpreters can\\'t really \"know\" an ancient language. We know quite a bit about Sumerian/Akkadian, Egyptian, Mayan, Aztec, etc. languages, but even with a large number of texts we are extremely limited when it comes to interpreting them, because there are no living users of those languages (except Mayan). We have examples of jokes, that are labeled as jokes, but we can\\'t tell why they\\'re funny, and so we\\'re very limited in being able to find and understand *un*labeled jokes. We have no idea as to the \"polarity\" of most of the texts. Did Sumerians really talk like this, or did the temples use specialized nondemotic languages? How sincerely did they embrace their own religious &amp; cosmological myths? What texts did they consider ironic, or beautiful, funny, frightening, sacred, profane, etc.? We can only guess. When it comes to dead languages, we are much like the computer reduced to observer status, and our picture of the language is perforce largely descriptive. Our only advantage over the computer is that we know when a particular reading is meaningful to us, though we have no way of confirming whether it was meaningful to actual users of the language.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know much about machine learning research, and would be interested in hearing more about it (particularly if you know a protocol that gets around these fundamental issues with language and meaningfulness).

To be able to answer this question you need to understand what language acquisition entails.\\n\\nFor both brains and machines, language acquisition entails what is known as unsupervised learning, or cluster analysis.  In performing cluster analysis, these systems learn correlations between certain auditory and visual patterns and the semantic information that those patterns represent.  For example, I might observe that someone says the word \"cat\" every time they\\'re in proximity to the animal, and eventually learn that the sound \"cat\" represents the animal symbolically.  This does not require that I query the user about their use of the word (though doing so might help, and again, this would be called active learning), it only requires that I\\'m able to observe patterns in the circumstances of that word\\'s use.',\n",
       "   '&gt;For example, I might observe that someone says the word \"cat\" every time they\\'re in proximity to the animal, and eventually learn that the sound \"cat\" represents the animal symbolically.  \\n\\nBut there\\'s no evidence that human beings can or do learn language this way. I linked to the article on [language acquisition about ten replies ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition), and while there are a few theories that hold to a classical empirical, \"see-say\" or \"picture-book\" theory like you describe, the vast majority are closer to my pragmatic definition of language. David Sousa summarizes prevailing views:  \\n\\n&gt;\"learning engages the entire person (cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains), the human brain seeks patterns in its searching for meaning, emotions affect all aspects of learning, retention and recall, past experience always affects new learning, the brain\\'s working memory has a limited capacity, lecture usually results in the lowest degree of retention, rehearsal is essential for retention, practice [alone] does not make perfect, and each brain is unique\"  \\n\\nI don\\'t think anyone doubts that children pick up new vocabulary, semantic information, morphemes &amp; phonemes, etc. from observation &amp; repetition the way you suggest. But on a much broader scale, they seem to acquire language through active involvement as language users. This goes for both comprehension and language production at all phases.  \\n\\nConsider that a child\\'s first speech act is a pre-linguistic vocalization: babies cry, instinctively, signalling hunger, discomfort, pain or danger without intending to. But they quickly learn to instrumentalize crying in a proto-linguistic way, realizing that their vocalizations lead to relief, and \"crying\" gradually gets replaced by \"calling\" over the first couple years of life. In other words, long before children are able to \"observe\" language as other people use it, they are learning to operationalize their own vocal cries as a form of communication.  \\n\\nSecondly, \"passive\" language acquisition is almost never actually passive. Rather, much of language comprehension is derived from adults talking to the child (often in \"child-directed language\" a.k.a. baby talk) and the child attempting to refine language comprehension &amp; production skills to get what it wants. [John Dore put it this way](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1765240):  \\n\\n&gt;An alternative view of early language development, which takes the SPEECH ACT as the basic unit of linguistic communication, is offered as a solution to the problems with the holophrase controversy as it now stands. We propose a more integrated description of the relations between functional and grammatical aspects of early communicative competence than is currently provided by sentence-oriented theories. In particular, we suggest that the child\\'s PRAGMATIC INTENTIONS gradually become GRAMMATICALIZED as semantic and syntactic structures.  \\n\\nIn other words, babies are never fly-on-the-wall mute observers of language. Whether they are being talked to, they are trying to talk themselves, or they are trying to understand the talk around them to better get what they want, they are active members of a language community from the beginning.  \\n\\n[Michael Tomasello calls these praxis-oriented approaches](http://www.let.rug.nl/~nerbonne/teach/language-learning/papers/tomasello_2000.pdf) (pdf) to linguistic acquisition \"usage-based\" theories:  \\n\\n&gt;Prelinguistic human infants are able to discriminate sounds and associate particular experiences with them (Haith and Benson 1997), but they do not comprehend and produce linguistic symbols until about their first birthdays. They do not do this quite simply because they do not yet understand communicative intentions. From about their first birthdays, however, infants begin to understand that when other persons are making funny noises at them they are trying to manipulate their attention with respect to some external entity. This understanding is one manifestation of a momentous shift in the way human infants understand other persons which occurs at around nine to twelve months of age, as indicated by the near simultaneous emergence of a wide array of joint attentional skills involving outside objects. This includes such things as following into the gaze direction and pointing gestures of others, imitating the actions of others on objects, and manipulating the attention of others by pointing or holding up objects to \"show\" them to others declaratively. The first language emerges on the heels of these nonlinguistic triadic behaviors (involving you, me, and it) and is highly correlated with them in the sense that children with earlier emerging skills of nonlinguistic joint attention begin to acquire linguistic skills at an earlier age as well (Carpenter, Nagell, and Tomasello 1998).  \\n\\nLanguage, in other words, develops out of the child\\'s functional needs as part of their evolving \"you, me, it\" conceptualization...they aren\\'t observing language, categorizing and schematizing it the way Linnaeus categorized plant genera, they are participating in it.  \\n\\nBringing an anthropological perspective to psycholinguistics, [Ochs and Schiefflin postulate that language acquisition is intrinsically related to socialization](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ptk9xUamLeUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=developmental+psycholinguistics+language+acquisition&amp;ots=Sq_wk6k1nX&amp;sig=-VUecx1LrBQHEnWtWsXyGTT2bfM#v=onepage&amp;q=developmental%20psycholinguistics%20language%20acquisition&amp;f=false), and language development proceeds according to speech acts that serve to integrate the child into a socio-cultural context:  \\n\\n1. The process of acquiring language is deeply affected by the process of becoming a competent member of a society.  \\n2. The process of becoming a competent member of society is realized to a large extent through language, by acquiring knowledge of its functions, social distribution, and interpretations in and across socially defined situations, **i.e. through exchanges of language in particular social situations**.  \\n\\nThe way human beings learn and use language is not purely descriptive, imitative or observational. Language is developed through (and I would say, defined as) meaningful social interactions mediated through a shared and coevolving system of symbols. There\\'s no evidence that people can learn a first language through passive observation only, and I submit that there\\'s no reason to think a machine can do it either.  \\n\\n',\n",

Now you\\'re arguing that without \"doing\" language, computers will not be able to interpret language as accurately as a language \"doer\" might.\\n\\nThis is true, all things remaining equal.  A computer which actively queries users will be able to achieve better results than one that doesn\\'t.  A human capable of communicating with other humans will learn language more effectively than one who has to learn from observation alone.  \\n\\nHowever, all things are not equal.  When comparing a computer that learns language passively to a human who learn language actively, computers possess many advantages wrt language acquisition.  The main advantage that computers possess, is that they can observe and process a great deal more information than any human can.  One can imagine a system which observes millions of conversations simultaneously, using each to update its linguistic model.  As I mentioned earlier, one can also imagine giving computers access to data streams that are denied to humans in most circumstances, like pulse rates, neural imaging, thermal readouts etc.',\n",
       "   '&gt; To begin with your argument was that without \"doing\" language computers would never be able to interpret language. Now you\\'re arguing that without \"doing\" language, computers will not be able to interpret language as accurately as a language \"doer\" might.  \\n\\nThat has been my argument from the beginning, with the proviso that \"as accurately\" actually implies a world of difference. The difference between \"let them eat cake\" as a sincere suggestion and \"let them eat cake\" as a callous dismissal of the plight of hungry people can get your head chopped off.  \\n\\nLanguage is inherently creative, with new meanings, new applications of rules, and new rules generated continually by users. A descriptive system will always be one step behind, trying to predict new semantic possibilities from past evolutions. And you\\'re right that machines keep getting faster and are able to analyze thousands or millions of conversations in parallel. I\\'d guess that descriptive language parsers will get asymptotically closer to making predictions about how language use will evolve, but without ever fully catching up.  \\n\\n&gt;The main advantage that computers possess, is that they can observe and process a great deal more information than any human can. One can imagine a system which observes millions of conversations simultaneously, using each to update its linguistic model. As I mentioned earlier, one can also imagine giving computers access to data streams that are denied to humans in most circumstances, like pulse rates, neural imaging, thermal readouts etc.  \\n\\nWhich is why I mentioned Amazon.com with its massive relational database serving thousands of queries and transactions per second. Only my suggestion would be, instead of having the system query past conversations and attempt to predict novel meanings... just make it an active language user. Find a system where humans and computers are highly motivated to interact using natural language. The humans will naturally modify their language use to accommodate the computer, while the computer will of course have to be designed to learn and adapt on the fly.  \\n\\nThis way the machine will be integrated as a language user, as opposed to a mere language observer. It will itself contribute to the evolution of language, and will therefore be in a position to creatively decide whether novel statements are \"meaningful\" and what exactly they might mean. Teach the machine to speak the same way humans are taught to speak, and the descriptive barrier can be overcome.',\n",
       "   'Marie Antoinette did not say \"let them eat cake\" when she heard that the French peasantry were starving due to a shortage of bread. The phrase was first published in Rousseau\\'s Confessions when Marie was only 10 years old and most scholars believe that Rousseau coined it himself, or that it was said by Maria-Theresa, the wife of Louis XIV. Even Rousseau (or Maria-Theresa) did not use the exact words but actually Qu\\'ils mangent de la brioche (\"Let them eat brioche [a rich type of bread]\"). Marie Antoinette was an unpopular ruler; therefore, people attribute the phrase \"let them eat cake\" to her, in keeping with her reputation as being hard-hearted and disconnected from her subjects.[27]\\n\\n\\nThis response was automatically generated from Wikipedia\\'s [list of common misconceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions)',\n",

Expecting all game studios, even those smaller and less renowned, to maintain online games for 20 years doesn't seem reasonable to me.  The changes in technology over 20 years will make any game obsolete - WoW has only survived because of massive, periodic overhauls by Blizzard.\\n\\nDownloading the latest patch is what you get, so the games are behaving like you'd expect here already.  OP made this thread because of the controversy with Nostalrius, which was a private WoW server (meaning not run by Blizzard) that Blizzard got shut down.  Nostalrius players then complained based on their belief that they should be allowed to play the version of WoW that they liked (Nostalrius ran a very early version of WoW).  So, in essence, their argument is that since Blizzard isn't supporting legacy WoW servers, Blizzard should allow people to make legacy servers themselves.\\n\\nThe trouble with this is it means people are playing WoW, and Blizzard gets no benefit.  To me, it is pretty obviously against copyright law - if you like the first edition of a book, but the publisher has moved on to a second edition and the first is out of print, you don't get to start your own publisher to print the first edition again and give nothing to the author.\",\n",

Nor do I think its reasonable to require companies to estimate how long they will maintain a product and then force them to abide by their estimate.\\n\\nEstimating years in the future is a very difficult thing to do.  Suppose a new game company releases a game and puts 5 years on the box.  Then their game flops and hardly anyone plays it - a year after release and they only have a handful of regular players.  Do you expect them to continue to maintain all websites and server hardware necessary to run a functioning online game for the next 4 years?  Are the remaining players entitled to damages if the game is shut down?  What about anyone who bought the game?  Suppose the company does maintain a modest server, just for the handful of players to keep playing on for the designated time.  If there is a sudden surge in the game\\'s popularity 3 years down the road, and the servers are not up to the task, is everyone entitled to damages because the game wasn\\'t available during the designated time period?\\n\\nIn the current state of the gaming industry, a failed game is already disastrous for an up and coming game developer.  What you are suggesting would make it doubly disastrous - not only is there not much revenue from selling the game, but the company is legally bound to continue running costly servers and websites (and paying associated employees) for a game hardly anyone plays.  You might say \"well they should have put a shorter time on the box\" but then you\\'re just making it even more difficult to break into the industry as a developer.  Sure, Activision can put 5 years on the box of their latest version of Call of Duty without batting an eye - they know people will play it, and in the rare case that they don\\'t, they are a big enough company to suck up the loss from having to maintain a failed game for 5 years.

Surprisingly given how much influence the far-right has always had in the U.S, it's still not been through the anything like Europe has as a result of allowing far right groups to flourish and is therefore in my view still very susceptible. The left has already pushed US culture about as far as it can at various points in its history (from the pre-Mcarthy unionising and large CPUSA membership, to sixties civil rights movements, Black Panthers, student rebellions and so forth).     \\n     \\nThe right has obviously had massive success with neoliberalism, but since that is organised amongst elites and focuses its violence so much on foreign policy the impact on US soil has been far more economic (growing inequality, privatisation, anti-union laws etc.) than it has cultural. I can't help but wonder if the time for the far right to finally start really influencing US culture is coming. There has recently been debate floating around about whether Donald Trump is a fascist and while I think that is hyperbolic I can't help but feel America 'missing out' on the rise of fascism in Europe makes their culture a little unprepared for what might happen if you allow Trump-style rhetoric to be carried to its ultimate conclusion. I can't say for certain, but I fear that the Tea Party logo might be all too foreboding: perhaps that coiled fascist snake will rise up in the culture if something unthinkable (to US minds) happens, like Bernie Sanders being elected president. The kind of far right rhetoric and slandering directed towards Obama, someone who by the standards of anywhere else in the world is actually right-wing, seems to stem largely from the fact that he is black and has a foreign-sounding name. Fear of otherness, un-Americaness, the association of all disliked policies with some sort of international socialist conspiracy... all fascist hallmarks. Obama's 'otherness' may not be enough to start far right militias forming, but someone who (inaccurately) actually calls *himself* a socialist could possibly spark the formation of some actual, serious organised resistance from far right extremists, and that could possibly manifest as terror attacks on US soil.

This country was instrumental in making \"liberal\" government (I.e., rule legitimized by the consent of the governed) the standard to which all enlightened societies are held. The US is the richest, most powerful civilization mankind has ever known.  Our currency is the reserve currency for the world.  Our language is the *lingua franca* of international commerce.  People come from all over the world to study at our universities, which are considered the best on the planet.  We are responsible for the personal computer revolution *and* the Internet revolution, with no indication that we won\\'t continue to be the center of human innovation. \\n\\nOn almost every measure -- with the exception of income inequality and middle class wage stagnation, which takes some real leaps to lay at the feet of FPTP balloting -- this is the best time in history to be an American.  People are living longer, crime is the lowest it\\'s been in decades, the current youth use fewer drugs, have fewer unwanted pregnancies, and commit fewer crimes than any time in the last half-century.

Go to any European country and ask how much they love their politicians.  In the Southern European countries, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Italy, which all have proportional representation, [less than 20% of people trust their government](http://www.gallup.com/poll/165647/trust-government-sinks-new-low-southern-europe.aspx).  The U.K., France, Germany, all trust their government [less than Americans](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jan/24/trust-in-government-country-edelman).\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what system you\\'re advocating that FPTP be replaced with.  Other systems have their own bugaboos.  For instance, while in the US the tendency is for the parties to move to the center to capture the median voter, in proportional systems the tendency is to dogmatically stake out your turf and consolidate your hardcore supporters against threats from the left and right, crystallizing into a few hardened groups.  \\n\\nBut it seems like you just are fed up with \"politics as usual\" and want a third party to have success.  But I don\\'t think that would be the panacea you think it would.  There\\'s no rule of nature saying a third party will be honest, or not take bribes, or care about you.  There\\'s no reason to expect they would be.  They\\'re politicians too.  Whoever your pet third party is may *seem* or even *be* honest and consistent now, when they have no power, and thus have no reason to make compromises to actually govern, and have no moneyed interests trying to curry their favor.  But believe me -- once your pet third party has some power, they will be subject to the same forces that influence the major parties, and amoral, opportunistic people will join the party and rise through the ranks.\\n\\nSo, in short, I think 1) our system is working pretty well if you take a step back, 2) third parties are not the silver bullet you think they are.']},\n",

       "   'The military is much more structured than almost any other profession. What your superiors say very much is law. There is very, very little freedom within the military - I\\'d say they are much less \"lawless\" than the average citizen. This is typically how order is maintained in the military - with an iron fist. Military order is ultimate order, and your superiors and your peers will stop you if you are acting in defiance of direct orders. \\n\\nI\\'d argue that propensity towards rape and sexual abuse in the military is probably contributed to most by several factors. \\n\\n-The very overly \"lawful\" and regimented system I already mentioned. Due to soldiers being discouraged from expressing their emotions and feelings (due to sexism - a la, \"don\\'t be a woman\" - as well as general trying to make soldiers into \"manly\" men) in healthy ways in this system, this comes out in private and is taken out on victims or those percieved as weak, sometimes sexually. This is also the cause of depression and suicides in the military; people cannot all survive being so repressed and kept from healthy emotional expression. \\n\\n-Lack of retribution. Men are typically not punished very severely for sexual crimes, and women are strongly discouraged from reporting them and oftentimes are actually punished in \"unrelated\" ways by their superiors when they do report them. Given that most other infractions are typically punished much more severely, this sends the message that the punishment was really only because the military had to punish you due to external pressure rather than because your peers and superiors actually believe you were in the wrong. \\n\\n-People prone to rape ARE attracted to the military. I think this is a comparatively insignificant factor (in that people who join and are prone to sexual violence could likely be fine if the atmosphere were healthier), however. Many people who are have lower socio-economic stature join the military as a way to \"get out\" of their old situation. People who have lower socio-economic stature tend to come from environments where sexual violence is more common, and this does impact them. Going to a military environment where sexual abuse is punished primarily with a slap on the hand and where there are *no* examples of healthy emotion management supports the conceptions their previous environment left them with. This is true of anyone coming from circumstances where sexism and sexual violence are somewhat normal or at least not actively discouraged. ',\n",

The car was *still in the process of stopping* when Loehmann jumped out and shot Tamir within less than 2 seconds of arriving. In addition, the video footage shows that Tamir at no point verbally or physically threatened the police officers nor did he take out or point the gun at them, he placed it in his waistband. Then there\\'s the fact that for over 4 minutes after the shooting the police officers **did not administer any first aid** which may have actually saved his life, and decided to throw to the ground and handcuff his 14 year old sister who ran over to him after being shot. \\n\\nThe icing on the cake is that the officer which shot Tamir Rice had a history of unstable behavior and problems at the previous police department he served at in Independence, Ohio:\\n\\n&gt; In a memo to Independence\\'s human resources manager, released by the city in the aftermath of the shooting, Independence deputy police chief Jim Polak wrote that Loehmann had resigned rather than face certain termination due to concerns that he lacked the emotional stability to be a police officer. Polak said that Loehmann was unable to follow \"basic functions as instructed\". He specifically cited a \"dangerous loss of composure\" that occurred in a weapons training exercise, during which Loehmann\\'s weapons handling was \"dismal\" and he became visibly \"distracted and weepy\" as a result of relationship problems. The memo concluded, \"Individually, these events would not be considered major situations, but when taken together they show a pattern of a lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions, I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct these deficiencies.\" It was subsequently revealed that Cleveland police officials never reviewed Loehmann\\'s personnel file from Independence prior to hiring him\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t see how you can have any doubt in the guilt of the police officers here.

I also don\\'t see the black men who don\\'t get shot by police because that doesn\\'t bring money to the media either.\\n\\nExcept when we look at the statistics we see that black people are shot by police disproportionately much more often than white people.\\n\\n&gt; However it\\'s better than the other outcome which is we let black criminals get away (because they are black) and police men get beat up.\\n\\nYou do understand that there are solutions between \"kill the black people\" and \"let black people get away with crime\" right?',\n",

If soccer were more qualitative, and points were given based on style and command of possession (as I\\'m sure many Arsenal fans wish they were, but I digress), then the casual would have a much harder time discerning what it means to \"win\".

       "   'Thanks for the response! I am hoping that I do understand the basic gist of your view, so I will reply accordingly:\\n\\nI definitely understand the appeal of objectivity, with regards to the scoring and eventual determination of a victor, in sports, competitions, etc. As you have pointed out, there are real drawbacks to the allowance of subjectivity in the process: it can be difficult for an audience to understand why a certain team won, a team\\'s victory can be ambiguous or disputable, etc. My impression is that this is what motivates you to push for strict objectivity in a sport.\\n\\nFirstly, I feel that objectivity *can* actually be found in a lot of the sports you listed as \"athletic activities\". For instance, in figure skating: sure, the judges\\' scores are personal, subjective, what have you. But you can actually frame it differently and say, \"It is the objective of this sport to sway a designated group of people, and have them vote for you as the winner\". The group is actually constant across all competitors, so there is definitely a case to be made here that the process is objective.\\n\\nSecondly, sports matches are constantly decided by factors that have nothing to do with an individual or team\\'s objective superiority. For example, if Roger Federer is slightly sick when he loses to Rafael Nadal in a Wimbledon championship match, within the objective context of determining who won the match there is absolutely no hesitation about crowning Nadal the champion. But as I am sure most Federer fans in this particular hypothetical situation would be extremely vocal about, the results of this championship match hardly determined who was the better player at the time. Roger was not feeling well, while Nadal was at 100%! Yet no one argues that Nadal, given the rules of the tournament, should have been given the trophy upon technically winning his match. So complete objectivity in the determination of a winner in a sport can still miss such extremely important considerations -- in this case, a consideration that many people feel drives at the heart of why sports exist at all. \\n\\nIf I am misrepresenting your view on this topic, please let me know!',\n",
       "   \"Certainly! It has been pointed out elsewhere (/u/cacheflow) that the speed of many of the events in dispute have lead to the quick human mind and its power of subjectivity as to simply be the best way to judge these events, and that may very well be! But yes, I favour objectivity largely for those reasons.\\n\\nI think that's stretching it a bit, but I can see where you're coming from. Even one's definition of objectivity is a little subjective based on frame of reference. :p\\n\\nI don't feel this example holds a lot of water, though. The rules preclude injury objectively from really dampening an outcome. Fans may be upset, but neutrals will know the result was fair. If Federer were that unwell, he could've retired or forfeited, but as he chose to play, he is responsible for his performance and the outcome.\\n\\nNo, that was a good response, a pleasure to discuss with you! :)\",\n",
       "   'Pleasure discussing with you as well. Just one more point I would like to elaborate on before I consider this conversation well and done!\\n\\nThe sick Federer example, I suppose, was meant to illustrate that it is almost impossible to ever find an \"objectively won\" sporting event. That is because, on top of tiny and minor illnesses and injuries that players may be sustaining but not advertising, so many other factors other than \"ability in the sport itself\" currently determine winners in sports, and \"ability in the sport itself\" is the key factor that drives most people\\'s (including yours, I believe) desire for objectivity. For instance, players\\' current mental states, which does not directly relate to one\\'s talent in a sport, greatly affects results. A player on a football team who has a fight with his wife before a game will most likely have his performance affected by this. Someone with your view might say in this instance that the entire game should be postponed, because it will not objectively measure who the better team is at the time. The game would involve other factors that have nothing to do with the participants\\' skills in the sport. But this is unrealistic to determine and enforce, so we live with the fact that this can and does occur. Another such factor would be the coin toss at the beginning of many sports matches. This undeniably introduces a variable into the equation that has nothing to do with a team\\'s superiority, but still has the potential to greatly influence the outcome. There is no other way to fairly designate who acts first, so we also live with this.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a certain amount of subjectivity can actually capture valid aspects of a sporting performance that objectivity cannot. Let\\'s say that, in a certain basketball game, both teams are performing equally well, and are tied with 1 second left. Miraculously, one player makes a wayward 3-point shot from behind the half-court line to steal the win. Someone who values judging an athletic performance purely on talent and skill might argue that declaring a winner based on this event does not do the match justice, as both teams displayed the same amount of skill and talent, but one team just happened to get lucky with a last-minute, Hail Mary shot. If basketball were somehow switched to a more \"subjective\" scoring method, it might be possible for a most justified result to occur: that both teams should have tied because their performances displayed equal amounts of talent, skill, teamwork, etc.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t say I agree with these points myself, but just something to think about.

Their findings from their experiment have been published in *Developmental Psychology* in 2006. Their study was also a part of the American Psychological Association in the U.S. Their experiment was called “Does Barbie Make Girls Want to Be Thin? The Effect of Experimental Exposure to Images of Dolls on the Body Image of 5- to 8-Year-Old Girls.”\\n\\nIn their experiment “a total of 162 girls, from ages 5 to age 8, were exposed to images of either Barbie Dolls, Emme dolls (U.S. size 16), or no dolls (baseline control) and then completed assessments of body image.\" The professors discovered that those exposed to Barbie doll images produced “lower self-esteem and a greater desire for a thinner body shape than in the other exposed conditions.” Although, the oldest girls did not have an immediate negative impact from the Barbie doll images. The study concluded that “these findings imply that, even if dolls cease to function as aspirational role models for older girls, early exposure to dolls epitomizing an unrealistically thin body ideal may damage girls’ body image, which would contribute to an increased risk of disordered eating and weight cycling.\"\\n\\nIf I get the chance later, I\\'ll post the link to the study.

Obvious ones are things like infection, accidentally cutting too deep and causing lasting harm, anemia, scarring (which you may regret later in life), self harm can be a part of an escalatory cycle that eventually leads to more physically damaging variants of self harm.\\n\\nShould you stop?  Well, it does have negative health implications.  There are healthier forms of streess relief.  For example, if you enjoy pain as a stress relief you could try holding your hand in an ice bath - which is uncomfortable, without risk of causing last of damage.  As far as enjoying the sight of blood, you can buy blood from your local butcher.\\n\\nUltimately, the reason that self-harm is concerning is not the health implications I listed above.

Self harm is also strongly correlated with schizophrenia, so that is another reason you should stop - as a diagnostic on yourself for psychological harm or schizophrenia.\",\n",

I lost almost 100 lb to meet their entrance requirements, went up to MEPS, did all their tests, then I got sat down with the counselor.\\n\\nThey weren't bothered by my history of depression or even that I'd taken medication for depression before; that could all be dealt with via a waiver. But the scars that came up in the physical was cause for immediate disqualification despite the fact I hadn't cut or even felt remotely like I had when I was a cutter in many many years. And so I was medically disqualified and, while I have my life back on track now, it really threw me off for quite some time and barred me from pursuing my dream. The scars are still obvious; though I haven't had any comments on them in a long time they make me very self-concious about wearing short-sleeved shirts.\\n\\nSo even if scars don't seem like a big deal now (at the time cutting I kind of saw the idea of having scars as something positive, that I wanted to look as damaged as I felt and such or that I would get attention for them and such) they may have some surprising consequences in the future. Even if you don't wish to pursue a profession that will assess your mental and physical status you may still be judged negatively even after you've left this time in your life years behind.\\n\\nSo while others like electricfistula here are correctly identifying problems with self-harm being much mroe serious than just some scars I just wanted to chip in and say that scars can be surprisingly serious problems on their own. \",\n",

Most states or cities have enacted statutes prohibiting the practice. There are [a few notable exceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_open_container_laws), like the Las Vegas Strip. \\n\\nSecond, and more relevant to your OP, it is [already illegal to be drunk in public](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_intoxication#United_States) in many states. But it's true that there are some major areas, [like New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_laws_of_New_York#Public_Intoxication), where it is not illegal. \\n\\nThird, you claim that being drunk in public is as or nearly as risky as driving drunk. This is wrong. Drunk driving kills about [10,000 people a year](http://www.centurycouncil.org/drunk-driving/drunk-driving-fatalities-national-statistics) in the US. The scuffles and annoyances you cite as problems with drinking in public do not come close to the social problems associated with drinking and driving. \\n\\nFourth, it's not clear that public intoxication laws are such a great idea. If you are over some legal limit in public, why should you be arrested if you're perfectly behaved? Because of something you *might* do? Why not just arrest people for the misbehavior you cite if and when it occurs: fighting, vandalism, etc. \\n\\nFinally, you talk about how you should have to get drunk at the bar or at home. How are you going to get drunk at the bar and then get home without breaking your drunk in public law?\",\n",
       "   '&gt; Third, you claim that being drunk in public is as or nearly as risky as driving drunk.\\n\\nI am not sure, but maybe someone can help me here. I believe there were some figures that demonstrated that more people die in car accidents due to being drunk as a pedestrian than as a driver.',\n",
       "   \"This was in one of the Freakonomics books. He argued that it's more dangerous for an individual to walk home drunk than to drive drunk.

Continuing this logic, why not legalize drunk driving, and only charge people when they crash? Drunk driving is bound to cause accidents the same way that public intoxication is correlated to lack of self control and therefore an increased chance of misbehaviour. Laws should prevent accidents before they happen, rather than waiting and punishing after.\\n\\nOther than that I agree with your points.\",\n",

Likewise driving itself, without intoxication correlates much more strongly with causing death than pedestrian intoxication, while isn't illegal as such does require proof of competency.

But, for the purposes of this CMV, I stated that I'm assuming that's the case.

That\\'s just the scientific method.\\n\\nIf that wasn\\'t the case, it would be equally viable to - let\\'s just go for the obvious one here - that vaccines cause autism, because that fact seems intuitively true and when it was first proposed it had not been disproven.\\n\\nMagic is also not precisely genetic. We have no idea how common muggle-borns are; considering they make up a decent chunk of Wizarding Britain, it\\'s probably not a spontaneous mutation each time (especially if magicalness is genetically complex) - either parents of Muggleborns carried recessive magical genes or there is an epigentic/extrabiological component we\\'re not privy to.\\n\\nSquibs are explicitly stated to be MUCH rarer than muggleborns are; if either of your parents are magical, you will almost certainly be magical.\\n\\nOne thing I learned upon researching this: if a couple (half- or pure-blood) has a squib child, that makes them exponentially more likely to have more squib children (assuming the list of known squibs on the wiki is a representative sample, which is a big if). In the 17th century a British wizard conceived seven sons, all squibs. Gilderoy Lockhart had two older sisters who were squibs, and he himself was pretty awful at all magic that wasn\\'t memory charms. Conversely, Dolores Umbridge, a fairly powerful pure-blood witch, had a younger squib brother.\\n\\nThus, there may be a magical event which damages a parent\\'s ability to pass on their magicalness after it occurs; perhaps this is the source of the hate-myth that muggleborns \"steal\" magic from pureblood wizards.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a bizarre number of people associated with Hogwarts and Illvermorny are squibs, if they are as uncommon as they are stated to be (this inconsistency might just be bad writing). If we keep going with the evolutionary/Darwinian viewpoint: squibs could provide some useful social function in primitive (and even modern) societies, especially in the education of young wizards. Perhaps by socializing young wizards with non-magical people, and grounding the interests of magical families to their non-magical offspring, they prevent wizarding groups from growing too hostile toward muggles, which was bad for the survival of both groups. They may play an unseen role in the process of \"magic transmission\" from parents to child, which may involve actors and forces beyond the nuclear family.\\n\\ntl;dr- magicalness is not a single-gene trait, and it may not even be genetic at all; half-blood and pure-blood couples produce squibs at roughly equal rates (which are exceptionally low, but seem to be concentrated in families associated - even after the fact of the squib\\'s birth - with magical education, although that may simply be a bias the plot gives us).\\n\\nIn general, muggle-born wizards are the most promising for wizarding society, which is backwards, undemocratic, corrupt, and incredibly clannish relative to muggle civilization. It needs fresh blood *very* badly (canonically, Hermione Granger, a muggle-born, becoming Minister of Magic in 2017 coincides with a liberalization of Wizarding Britain). However, muggle-borns don\\'t happen on purpose, so the most ethical deliberate pairing which will produce a magical child is a magic-muggle union. Continued pureblood endogamy is both stunting the culture of the wizarding world and, more directly, draining their gene pool with every generation; it is also concentrating wealth (whose nature is unclear in the HP verse, there are some arbitrary things you can\\'t conjure out of thin air, but wizards still shouldn\\'t experience scarcity) in a reactionary, fifth-column upper class dominated by violent political affiliations.',\n",

But I\\'m not sure whether or not the modern wizarding world has achieved sufficient genetic diversity to keep to itself without defects. \\n\\nMore socially than genetically (we just have no real numbers for populations), and somewhat specifically to the UK: the most prominent example is that we are never shown any real evidence that, even under a legitimate government, Wizarding Britain is a democracy; the means of the Minister of Magic\\'s appointment are unclear, although he can be removed very quickly if he loses approval from unknown persons. Unlike Wizarding America, which has a unicameral, elected legislature as well as a president, there is no apparent magical parliament or system of elections; there is no evidence of a party system or even basic political awareness outside of a brief division into pro- and anti-Dumbledore factions. The Wizenagemot is an ancient council which appears vaguely similar to a national supreme court - its members are not elected and may be dismissed at the Minister\\'s pleasure.\\n\\nWizarding Britain is essentially governed by a self-appointed bureaucracy which has descended into a dictatorial police state on three occasions: during and immediately after the First Wizarding War, in the 1970s, when the Ministry merrily waived every aspect of a modern criminal justice system and used medieval torture chambers to coerce confessions from Death Eaters, shortly before the Second Wizarding War, from 1994 to 1995, when the Fudge Ministry used Wizarding Britain\\'s dominant, apparently state-owned newspaper, to slander Dumbledore and Harry Potter for suggesting Voldemort was back (Dumbledore and several of his allies were forced into literal exile during this period, and leading up to it he was purged from all official government positions), and finally from 1997 to 1998 when, following the murder of the MoM and a pro-Voldemort coup, it became a puppet organization for a Death Eater dictatorship; supposedly the transition between the legitimate and post-coup governments was noticeable but not extreme.\\n\\nIn addition to being deeply illiberal, the Ministry is also shockingly corrupt: Wizarding Britain is dominated socially by a number of wealthy pureblood families, prominently including the Malfoys. Many - particularly the ones characterized as \"evil aristocrats\" rather than \"scary criminals\", Rowling\\'s classism analogies being about as subtle as a tungsten mallet - essentially bribed their way to freedom and good status after being caught working for a murderous terrorist organization/insurgency. Lucius Malfoy continues to use gold (Wizarding society has not transitioned to a singular metal standard, let alone fiat money) to pass pro-pureblood legislation well into the 90s, after he was publicly accused of causing the deaths in the Chamber of Secrets a few years earlier (with no apparent alibi; his patsy, Ginny Weasley, apparently took no action against him because of her family\\'s relatively low social standing).\\n\\nIn addition to being autocratic, vulnerable to takeover by tyrants, and financially dependent on a wealthy cabal of magical klansmen, the Ministry has some barbaric practices which have no real political explanation:\\n\\n* The use of dementors, aka depression elementals, to subdue and demoralize prisoners at Azkaban; they are also deployed to a school(!) despite having serious physical and psychological effects on their surroundings. We are led to believe Azkaban is one of many criminal justice facilities the Ministry has, and is only used for serious, dangerous criminals - until Hagrid is sent there without trial, for weeks, due to suspicion (entirely on the basis of anti-giant racism) that he is responsible for the killings in the Chamber of Secrets; the Ministry later sends many other minor criminals there as Voldemort\\'s return becomes public and they attempt to crack down. They\\'re also clearly not particularly helpful to prisoner containment: multiple breakouts occur under their watch, and non-Death-Eater prisoners remain in the prison after the dementors defect.\\n* Oh yeah, the soul-eating demons that the government contracted all their security work out to? They just straight-up switch sides because Voldemort is cool with them eating people\\'s souls. That\\'s right: the only thing keeping Wizarding Britain\\'s entire criminal justice system functioning, up until 1995, was that nobody had offered their monster wardens a marginally better deal.\\n* House elves! Because what a society of all-powerful superbeings able to manifest their whims with but a thought *really* needs is enslaved manual labor. This is made worse by the fact that, like all non-human intelligent beings, house elves are implied (and actually shown) to have extremely powerful magical abilities which can violate laws human magic cannot: combined with the fact that their entire species exists in magically-bound slavery, we have to assume humans conquered and subjugated them at some point in the past. Hermione is, AFAIK, one of the first people in the whole country to question this behavior- pretty much every other character tells her with a totally straight face that they \"like being ~~slaves~~ servants\".\\n* Massive speciesism in general: Dolores Umbridge, in particular, attained enormous power in the Ministry both before and after Voldermort\\'s rise, and she had *no* trouble using this authority to pass laws denying employment to werewolves and permitting the Ministry to seize property from goblins, another non-human race that live largely as second-class citizens in Wizarding Britain. Casual racism against non-humans is implicitly Ministry policy, and it becomes explicit under Voldemort\\'s rule (something precisely none of the Ministry\\'s many employees seem to object to, until they\\'re hauled into the interrogation chamber themselves).\\n\\n----\\n\\ntl;dr, by merit of their isolation from the muggle world, wizards have missed out on the birth of modern democracy (along with literally *any* of the personal freedoms that implies) as well as several different civil rights movements that have been a long time coming (it\\'s implied Voldemort\\'s final defeat set the ball rolling there). Due to the undemocratic nature of their society, its generally small size, and its political domination by wealthy, landed conservatives with an irrational disdain for muggles, muggle-borns, non- or \"part-\"humans, and in some circumstances half-bloods, uncountable barbaric practices have been maintained almost into the 21st century.\\n\\nEven if Hermione successfully democratizes the Ministry (it is implied she does), without a majority of voters who are familiar with democratic traditions (unlike pure-bloods, who know about as much about democracy as an Iraqi farmer) it would easily collapse back into aristocratic, bureaucratic authoritarianism, and remain vulnerable to takeover by another pureblood terrorist or demagogue like Voldemort, who will always have strong support among the magical upper class until their values are forced to change.']},\n",

I thought you were talking about ephebophilia. I think ephebophiles exist on a spectrum with pedophiles on one end and gerontophiles on the other. Adults who are consistently attracted to minors in the 14-18y range must be attracted to features that are present only in that stage of life. I'm assuming those features are a mix of adult and child-like characteristics since 14-18y olds are still developing.     \\n\\nIf you're talking about somebody who is incidentally attracted to minors it becomes a different story. However, you should remember two things: that for a lot of people the words minors and children are interchangeable and for adults attraction is sexualized. When an adult expresses attraction to a minor (to whom, how, and why?) it is seen as negative because it expresses desire for an underdeveloped person. Now, minors may look completely like adults but they aren't fully developed in the brain department. \\n\\nI want to ask you another question to clarify your position.

While I am not aware of studies regarding the distinguishing of 100 different wines, I happen to personally know people who are very good at it.  I myself can tell a person what region of France a bottle comes from in a blind taste.  My father is very impressive. If he did a blind tasting of Burgundy Pinot Noirs, he can tell you the vineyard and the vintage with 90% accuracy.\\n\\nNow, as far as studies go, [this one](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/37328) is pretty interesting.  It doesn\\'t measure specific vineyards/vintages, but it does look at price, which for wines is usually a correlation with quality and brand recognition.  This study shows that for the average person, there is a negative correlation between price of wine and enjoyment.  However, I have to stress \"average\".  With top wine tasters, they found the opposite to be true, more expensive wines are more enjoyable.  So on one hand, you are correct, it is not something an average person can do, but there are people who can.\\n\\nIf you yourself are interested in picking up wine tasting [NPR has a great beginner guide] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/06/26/194212435/fruity-with-a-hint-of-bologna-a-slacker-s-guide-to-wine-tasting).  At the very least, make sure you know how to tell if a wine is \"corked\", that way if you or your party order an expensive bottle that has gone bad, you will be able to send it back and be justified.  I personally love wine tasting and I think it is a great hobby.  Going to vineyards requires being outdoors, and I love food so pairing a nice wine makes the meal that much more complete.  If you want to give wine tasting a try, you should give yourself regular blind tests and strike up conversations with the sommelier when you go to restaurants, just make sure you enjoy what you are drinking!',\n",

In essence, what you're suggesting is that the only victories worth celebrating are those which come without sacrifice. A soccer team that wins 4-3 cannot celebrate having given up 3 goals, therefor celebrating the win would be inappropriate. The winning lottery ticket cost money which was paid for with hours of my life.\\n\\nThe other incomplete part of your argument is to associate these celebrations with what was lost. You specifically mention celebration of death, yet all across the world and throughout history humans have celebrated death. We do this not because we have lost a person but to cherish and remember their life as it was and the sacrifices they made along the way. The vast majority of celebrations focus on the lives of those of those we've lost, not on their deaths.\\n\\nIn order to justify celebrations surrounding losses, it's important to consider the alternatives. If another country *invades your homeland*, the alternative is to be tortured, slaughtered, enslaved, and subjugated. Your government will be abolished, your politicians deposed, the laws of your nation violated, and your very culture may even be dismantled. These are things aren't imaginary, they have been happening repeatedly throughout history. We need only look as far as the Native Americans to see how warfare can be the only option.\\n\\nPart of what you're getting at, though, isn't so much the celebration of warfare as the pursuance of it. To actively launch into wars and to take a very forward role in the world is a questionable behavior. Your argument makes a better case for pacifism than it does for celebrations. Your initial example of good advice for a child in a fight is a decent anecdote in favor of pacifistic behavior but it doesn't really explain why we shouldn't be relieved or happy to survive hardship.\\n\\nA last way to look at it is to focus on those ideas: relief and hardship. War is a hardship. Celebration is a relief. Regardless of whether the hardship is justified, overcoming it is cause for relief. Again, regardless of the justification of the hardship, that relief is still a human emotion expressing that stress, fear, and tension have ceased--all things worth celebrating. We celebrate an end to fear, an end to stress, and end to suffering, and end to violence, an end to conflict, and an end to struggle. A plateau has been reached, for better or for worse, and we celebrate the solid ground to rest on.\",\n",

In an intolerant society, being left-handed would easily cause mental stress, trouble functioning in social, work, and family activities (and would therefore be a mental illness).\\n\\n\\n&gt;Just as someone with anorexia nervosa looks in the mirror and sees fatness where there is (typically) none, someone who is transgender looks in the mirror and sees the wrong physical characteristics looking back at them.\\n\\nThe difference is that being a different gender is not unhealthy, in the way that being undernourished is. \"Female\" is not a tragic, damaging condition, in the way that \"starving\" is.\\n\\n&gt;Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of -- but it should alter the way we discuss the policies and issues relating to people who suffer from it. In short, we should avoid glorifying it. \\n\\nYou are confusing \"being transgender\" with \"having gender dysphoria\". Nobody glorifies gender dysphoria. Transgender people who are left to express themselves as they please, and are supported in whatever transition they may or may not make, are seeking to lessen their dysphoria, not celebrate it.\\n\\n\"Transgender identities come with far higher rates of depression and suicide.\"\\n\\nTransitioning has been [repeatedly shown in studies](http://transascity.org/quality-of-life-in-treated-transsexuals/) to be effective in lessening these negative effects of gender dysphoria. Arguing against transitioning is arguing for a lower quality of life for these people.\\n\\n&gt;Children should be taught about what transgenderism means, but they must have the space to figure their gender identities out for themselves.\\n\\nThen you agree completely with Ma-Pa\\'s approach, and similarly disagree with parents who naturally raise their children to be cisgender.\\n\\n&gt;Ma-Pa\\'s household in \"forward-thinking\" Sweden is depicted as trendy rather than atypical.\\n\\nHaving seen the documentary, I\\'m not sure how you can come to this conclusion. It seems repeatedly emphasized in the documentary that this type of parenting *is indeed atypical*, and not \\'trendy\\' at all. Let me suggest that it is a common \\'conservative\\' mistake to claim that being transgender is now \"cool\", \"hip\", \"popular\", or \"a fad\"... when in fact, what they mean is simply that it is \"accepted\" or \"tolerated\". \\n\\n&gt;...and they consider it an appropriate ideal to allow children to undergo gender reassignment surgeries that will affect the rest of their lives.\\n\\nLet me suggest that you are slightly exaggerating the facts here, in an unfortunately common way. From what I understand, almost no transgender children undergo genital reconstructive surgery. Instead, they might use puberty blocking hormones (which are surprisingly safe and reversible), or, less frequently, undergo hormone therapy (also surprisingly safe, if slightly less reversible). Genital reconstructive surgery is almost always reserved for after they\\'ve reached an older age. Many standards of care require both a psychological evaluation, and a long timespan of living as the desired gender, before such an operation.It seems to me that this has, unfortunately, been spun into the false myth that many parents are having their children undergo genital surgery.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, perhaps most to the point is to consider what approach to gender dysphoria you are actually endorsing. *Not* transitioning? Raw counseling? Trying to affirm the \"natural\" gender? Although I admit that, to my knowledge, no study has ever been done on the effectiveness of these approaches, from what I understand, it is generally understood in the literature that these would almost certainly lead to *worse* results (more suicide, higher rates of depression, etc).\\n\\n\\nJust my two cents!

       "  'comments': [\"&gt;violence is often public.\\n\\nBut it isn't. Its *depiction* is often public, but actual violence is hard to come by (again, if we're talking about mainstream America).\\n\\nThat said, you make a good point. Sex and violence are not at all two sides of the same coin and so shouldn't really be equated. The main reason for this is that sex itself can embody a lot of violence. And herein lies a great problem: if we are accustomed to depicted violence but unaccustomed to depicted sex, we run the danger of not seeing or even being perfectly comfortable with violence in the course of sex. Of course, this is perhaps unavoidable, but the problem lies in that we have no way of dealing with this meaningfully, since violence is invisible to us while sex is taboo and therefore the natural target of our attention.\\n\\nWe can observe this in the practice of blaming a sexual assault victim for the way they were dressed. The fact of the assault is the fact of violence, which we are accustomed to and therefore less likely to be outraged by. The fact of the victim's dress is expressive of their sex. Since sexual expression in public is (historically) taboo, we see in this a transgression on the victim's part, to which we can now assign blame. (Obviously, the above example is dealing entirely with relative rather than absolute values of outrage/transgression/etc. That is, the argument is that relatively speaking our outrage at public sexual expression is much greater than it should be, while our outrage at violence is much less than it should be.)\"]},\n",

They are not overly powerful and organized. There are divisions within the FSA and Assad has consolidated his power much more effectively. Once the civil war settles down, it will be much easier for a third party (UN,USA,Europe) to undermine the FSA and remove it from power. If Assad wins, that will not happen. 2. Assad has escalated this war to the point where it takes radical extremism to be effective. 12-18 months ago, when the revolution was  more idealistic, if Assad had decided he didn\\'t want to murder his own people then the FSA would have not grown into the monster it has become.

It makes sense if you consider it, a group has extremely loose ties to al-Qaeda, lets call them al-Qaeda, because honestly if they named every single organization (that are very independent) it would be extremely confusing. Really the only place that al-Qaeda was a significant contributor to a movement was the thing in Mali a few months ago. If the FSA relied heavily on al-Qaeda support then Assad would crush them. Like I said, the support of Hamas was the game changer for the FSA. \\n\\nI don\\'t really have a decent answer for the Syrian Army question. \\n\\nIn terms of the power vacuum, and this discussion has made me think about it more. I imagine, if the revolutionaries took power, they would receive tons of support from Iran/Russia. Iran is easily the most powerful country in the region, so I imagine that would go a long way towards stabilizing the nation. Also, regionally, Syria is surrounded by very influential nations.

Perhaps you don\\'t like federalism and prefer a strong national government, but that\\'s not really a *Constitutional* issue if you ask me, but a opposition to the American system of government in general.\\n\\n&gt; it\\'s deliberately discriminatory\\n\\nAs originally written, sure. But as amendmended? (Which is what actually matters today.) I don\\'t see how, unless you\\'re arguing that it\\'s discriminatory against non-U.S. citizens.

But even as a fairly civil libertarian minded person, I don\\'t see the problem with that.

We can see from the writings of the Founders that their intention was to constrain government. \\n\\nI\\'d like to point out that the Constitution *does* contain some strong rights and principles. Our freedom of speech rights are stronger than any country I know of, for instance. We have a strong separation of church and state. There\\'s several amendments devoted to the rights of the accused, as well as those that expand and protect voting rights. There\\'s more, but I believe I\\'ve made my point.\\n\\nThe problem lies with politicians and judges who care more about expanding the power of government than following the Constitution. You can\\'t blame the Constitution for people not following it anymore than you can blame murder laws for senseless killings.\\n\\n&gt; relatively few protections for anyone or anything.\\n\\nRelative to what? Constitutions that were written more recently? The Constitution doesn\\'t explicitly protect the freedom of speech over phone lines, for instance, but only because they didn\\'t exist at the time. But the 4th amendment has been made to apply to those things. \"Papers and effects\" also means \"emails and stuff in your car\" even though those things didn\\'t exist in the 1790s.\\n\\n&gt; due to our tradition of never actually changing it\\n\\nThis is either a misunderstanding of the nature of the Constitution, or a bit of hair-splitting, I\\'m not sure which.\\n\\nLet\\'s take the 18th Amendment for instance, the one that established Prohibition of alcoholic beverages. It was repealed some 14 years later by the 21st Amendment, yet the 18th is still included in most copies of the Constitution. But so what? It hasn\\'t been in effect in nearly 85 years.\\n\\nI\\'ve also seen copies of the Constitution that have lines drawn through the portions that are no longer in effect, for those who want a visual depiction. Just because we didn\\'t take a thing of white out to the original copies of the Constitution doesn\\'t mean the more objectionable parts are still in effect.\\n\\n&gt; just tacking overruling contradictions onto the end of it.\\n\\nWhat\\'s wrong with that? The Founders foresaw the need for the Constitution to be changed. Instead of requiring a brand new Constitution to be drafted, they included an Amendment process. It\\'s different, yes, but by design. Constitutional amendments should be harder than mere legislation.\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed that some people treat the Amendments like they\\'re somehow inferior to the original text. There\\'s this notion that it\\'s not good enough to merely amend it, and the whole thing must be tossed out periodically. I don\\'t understand that desire.

This was one of the most crucial advances in the way popular music was to be produced. But Lennon &amp; McCartney didn’t just influence all popular music that followed them. They influenced classical music too.\\n\\n&gt; The leading classical composers of our own era have turned back to traditional harmony. More than anyone, Lennon &amp; McCartney prefigured this trend. They showed that the old musical forms could be refashioned and refreshed, to make music that was both exciting and popular, and sophisticated and new. They, more than anyone, saved the western musical tradition from extinction, and gave it a new purpose and a direction. Not bad going for two boys who met at a local church fete and taught themselves their instruments.\\n\\ntl;dr: Lennon &amp; McCartney were self-taught musicians who developed from being capable only of simple pop songs to revolutionising the way popular music could be made and influencing not only all pop music to come after it, but western classical music too.\"]},\n",

I've played a bunch of characters, and couldn't give a damn about race\\n\\nMy girlfriend used to work at GameStop and I can promise you that a significant number of gamers, many of the younger variety, balked openly at the idea of a lead character that didn't look like Marcus Phoenix or Nathan Drake (white male). We do not live in a particularly racist region, either.\\n\\nI was surprised, as I too don't really care the protagonist is as long as I enjoy the gameplay and the story is solid. \",\n",

       "   'I think you\\'re perspective on this issue is based on two similar but separate misconceptions:\\n\\nThe first is that our past and somewhat current situation is not the result of \"pandering\" in it\\'s own right. There is a natural tendency to view our current status as the default, arrived at through default means of no extraordinary effort on anyone\\'s part. This is false especially when we are speaking about media. The exclusion of people of color isn\\'t something that just happened as a natural byproduct of their being more white folk around. It is, in a significant part, absolutely because media has always been shaped by people who \"whined and screamed the loudest\" and thus \"getting what they want.\" The historical and ongoing exclusion of people of color isn\\'t a passive, secondary byproduct of a functioning meritocracy, it is was and is an active and willful pandering to the sensibilities of people who believe that people of color should only be seen in specific contexts and playing specific characters.\\n\\nAn overt example of this kind of pandering is in the earlier days of cinema scenes which included positive representations black folk and culture where often included in films in ancillary was, disconnected from the main plot to facilitate editing those scenes out for white audiences that where hostile towards such representations (https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2009/04/27/race-entertainment-and-trans-racial-historical-borrowing-the-case-of-lindy-hop/). More nuanced and recent versions of the same sort of pandering, or the expectation that white audiences *should* be exclusively/mostly pandered to, can be seen in reactions to the hunger games book accurate casting of people of color in a few roles. The reactions go far beyond simply not having paid attention to character descriptions in the book. Many of the reactions state that they could not rectify the notion that the sweet child from the book that was also black. That the place for a black child in a story is specifically *not* as an innocent kind child. If you google \"first black/Asian/whatever _____\" filing in the blank with whatever media role you please you will most likely find a slew of contemporary views expressing that the individual in question does not belong in that role as a direct result of the color of their skin.\\n\\nAll of that is just as \"pandering\" and a result of people \"whining and screaming the loudest\" as the inclusion of people of color might be today.\\n\\nThe second misconception is that the cause and mechanisms of the changes we seeing are based on creators \"shoehorning of beliefs\", as opposed to creators giving those fans what they want in exchange for sweet sweet dolla\\' bills.\\n\\nI\\'d like to specifically talk about this:\\n\\n&gt;And look at Marvel as well. They became more SJW-focused, changed a bunch of characters, and abandoned their fan base. And since those that are now more represented aren\\'t really buying much of new stuff, nor are SJWs, the old fan base is declining because the writing has gotten more SJW-focused by shoehorning their beliefs, they are losing sales. But they apparently aim to change that now, to try and get back their fan base.\\n\\nI\\'m not an expert on Marvel\\'s financial history, but my impression is that they haven\\'t been rolling in the dough since the 90\\'s collector bubble burst, and even before that they had not been a hugely financially stable company since the 60\\'s. Blaming their current financial state (whatever that state may be) on a relatively recent development while ignoring their long and storied history of financial instability is a bit disingenuous.\\n\\nIt is equally disingenuous to characterize those changes as universal, or as the reason long term fans are leaving. Again this is only to my personal knowledge, but I\\'m under the impression that the largest character changes are happening to mainly alternate versions of classic characters or secondary characters that never had a huge following to begin with while bigger names and titles more or less still maintain their \"original\" incarnations and continuity. The classic comics are\\'t being rapidly pushed out or ignored in favor to some non-gender binary lesbian atheist community organizer superheros. The classics still exist, are still widely available, and largely unchanged. The only thing that has changed is that new and old heros and stories are being developed to cater (pander) to a new audience **as well as** the long term fan base that already exists and would like to see these new ideas, people and stories. Marvel and other media outlets aren\\'t \"shoehorning their beliefs\" into their product, they are wisely responding to the wants and needs of their customers. That ain\\'t \"social justice\" that\\'s fucking capitalism.\\n\\nIf a person really is a loyal long term fan of comics, and they leave due to the changes happening today it ain\\'t because comics are being ruined, those comics still exist in spades, they are leaving because they cannot bare the thought of comics catering to anyone but themselves. They are leaving because they believe that only *they* should be pandered to, to the active exclusion of anyone else.',\n",

       "   '&gt; No. Believe it or not, I\\'ve seen a lot of movies/series/etc that aren\\'t American. I\\'ve watched at least 3 series to their end, two of them Spanish (over 100 episodes each), and one Brazilian which had a mix with Arab (as far I recall) storylines. I\\'ve seen more non-American movies than I can count, because I don\\'t limit myself to the content I watch or consume (unless I can\\'t stand the language).\\n&gt; I also, currently, watch over 18 shows (not at once, lol), and while it might be a small sample, ALL of them have PoC, often as one of the main characters. Now, ask yourself - how many PoC have actually seen movies outside of the country? There\\'s a huge market out there, created by PoC for PoC. It\\'s not the same, and it doesn\\'t justify anything, but it\\'s worth mentioning in my opinion.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t making any personal comment or judgements towrads you. You have nothing to justify on that front.\\n\\n&gt;how many PoC have actually seen movies outside of the country? There\\'s a huge market out there, created by PoC for PoC. It\\'s not the same, and it doesn\\'t justify anything, but it\\'s worth mentioning in my opinion.\\n\\nThe existence of other media, in other countries has no bearing on the types of media that people would like to see here. And the idea that POC should settle for media created by POC by POC, is kind of a tacit suggestion that POC\\'s have a place in media, but that it isn\\'t in the mainstream media. In other words \"stay in your place\". Please, please, please note that I do not believe that is how you feel. I know that you do not feel that way. But the rhetoric you are using to justify a system that has always been based on active pandering to whites aligns with that view.\\n\\nFor the record, there have always been alternative venues, media, and stars for people of color that have been historically separate from mainstream entertainment. Black centric films have existed nearly as long as the mainstream film industry, black theaters, black summer resorts, black comedy clubs. \\n\\nFrom my perspective, one of the main goals of increasing diversity in media is not just that representation of historically maligned people increases, but more importantly that the notion of \"White = default\" and \"Anything else = other\" is put in the ground where it belongs. Because it\\'s a fucking lie.\\n\\n&gt;True, that\\'s after all, the main purpose, but SJWs as far I\\'ve noticed don\\'t really give a toss all that much; so it really comes down to those who actually do want to watch such things.\\n\\nAnd there are people who want to watch those things **AND** also care about seeing the stories of POC, or just want to see a person of color in a story that doesn\\'t revolve around the fact that they are a POC. The impression you are attempting to give is that droves and droves of white comics fans are abandoning ship because of some small changes to characters in the name of \"social justice\". What you are denying in this kind of hand wavey way is that there are long term committed comics fans, both white and people of color, who **WANT** these changes to happen. There isn\\'t some huge and definite dividing line between \"All the people who actually like comics\" and \"All the people who want some slight changes\", The groups overlap.\\n\\n&gt;As for Marvel, I was mainly referring to the comics, whose salles seemed to have taken a sharp decline over the last 12 or so months.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if that\\'s true, but again you are referring to a company whose entire history has been punctuated with busts and booms. It\\'s really not a surprise that a company that has always had financial trouble is having financial trouble now. And it\\'s disingenuous to state that it is unequivocally due to one factor that also happens to be the thing that\\'s itching your craw. \\n\\n&gt;Thor has been changed to a woman (which has been discussed in the past, and you can see why it\\'s illogical here: https://archive.is/pNCE2), \\n\\nApparently not: As part of a story line Thor can\\'t currently lift the hammer, someone else can, doesn\\'t refer to themsleves as thor and this has all happened in past comics as well (http://time.com/2987551/thor-marvel-woman/)\\n\\n&gt;Iron Man to a young black girl, which I don\\'t have an issue with in movies, because as far I recall, Robert Downer J. didn\\'t plan to film more movies;\\n\\nAgain, as part of a story line tony stark has stepped out of the role for a while and a new character is using the suit. Iron man hasn\\'t been changed to a black woman. And again someone else using the suit isn\\'t anything new (http://screenrant.com/characters-been-iron-man-besides-tony-stark/?view=all)\\n\\n&gt;as for comics, I don\\'t know much about that one. There are others too, and that\\'s part of the issue. Spiderman has been changed, \\n\\nThere hasn\\'t been a decade in the existence of spiderman in which he hasn\\'t changed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRCTODFvQD8)\\n\\n&gt;as far I recall Captain America as well (or it\\'s just double... I don\\'t know), plus the crap writing that focuses more on Social Justice, along with general worse writing.\\n\\nCaptain america has changed several times over his life, has always been the more \"social justice-y\" hero of the pantheon, and comic book writing has never been the pinnacle of prose often, if not down right reliably bad.\\n\\nYour list of complaints looks like this: \"All this shit that has happened before in comics, will undoubtedly revert back as it always has, and then will happen again is unacceptable because I perceive other people\\'s perspective and desires reflected in these changes\". \\n\\n&gt;No one, at least not that I\\'ve seen, has issues with diversity; that\\'s not the crux of the issue, but the above; and for me, forced diversity. \\n\\nDo you acknowledge that the lack of diversity is every bit as \"forced\"? When you use rhetoric like \"forced diversity\" you are putting forth and reinforcing the idea that the \"old state\" was not forced, that it just kind of happened. If the lack of diversity was in fact \"forced\" than what other course of action do people have but to \"force\" their own world view as well?\\n\\n&gt;The older fans aren\\'t buying stuff because they don\\'t care to read about female Thor beating the shit out of a guy because he insulted her feminism.\\n\\nFirst off I don\\'t think that actually happened. But there are a lot of older fans who **ARE** buying stuff because they do like new and interesting story lines and dynamic changes in character.\\n\\n&gt;It\\'s low hanging fruit, especially in fantasy, and imo it shouldn\\'t have a place there. \\n\\nHow is thor himself not low hanging fruit that panders to the godlike fantasies and wish fulfillment of boys? \\n\\n&gt;If they can\\'t do it better, then why even bother?\\n\\nOne has to start somewhere...\\n\\n\\nYou still seem to be working under the impression that comics, from their very inception weren\\'t\\' pandering, shoehorning, poorly written, wish fulfillment. They absolutely are. The only reason to get upset over those things at this moment, and not acknowledged the dozen of hundreds of times these things have happened before is that someone else\\'s wishes are being catered to, and you perceive pandering as a zero sum game.\\n\\nAnd just a side note: The less you use phrases like \"SJW\" the more credible **anything** you say will be. You may not like \"feminists\" for whatever your reasons but if you base all your thoughts and decisions on being against someone, you\\'re basically the same as them. If you do have problems with \"SJWs\" and \"feminists\" you\\'re best course of action is to disengage from the binary rhetoric they engage in (meaning pretty much stop reading or engaging in stupid internet arguments with disingenuous people acting in bad faith) and engage with their ideas and philosophy instead.

       "   '&gt; I won\\'t address the second part, as I\\'ve already said: \"and it doesn\\'t justify anything\", but merely pointed out that there\\'s a huge market out there, and if you are (at the moment) not getting what you desire (not you in particular), you should try and look elsewhere.\\n\\nI understand that you aren\\'t justifying and said as much in my reply. However, regardless of your intention, pointing out that \"You get get it elsewhere\" is employing rhetoric that ignores the fact that this has always been the case, and the reason it has always been the case is because POC have been actively excluded from participation in mainstream media. You aren\\'t upset with the fat that media is \"pandering\", because media has **always** pandered primarily to white audiences. What you are upset with is that media is no longer pandering exclusively to whites. Any criticism of the current changes of audience and media for \"pandering\" without the admission that \"pandering\" has always happened is suspect.\\n\\n&gt;I\\'m more interested in good, creative stories, and allowing freedom to those writing them and directing them to find best actors possible for the role, unless the race/where the character is from plays a huge part in the movie, and thus it has to be white/black/whatever.\\n\\nThat\\'s a noble stance. If you honestly feel that way you should be equally upset, if not more so, for the 100 years of media in which this was not the case, as significant portions of the creative and media world were actively excluded in order to \"pander\" to the \"loudest and whiniest\" people. Even worse there are countless examples of the work of people of color being stolen or co-opted by white artists and repackaged in order to pander to the audience.\\n\\n&gt;You are assuming they are white. I don\\'t know that. I\\'m sure you could find PoC who are tired of it. \\n\\nYou are correct, I spoke the assumption aloud.\\n\\n&gt;You are assuming they are small changes. They aren\\'t.\\n\\nI\\'m assuming that the changes are not larger or more significant than the changes that have already happened time and time again in the comic book world which have ranged from minuscule to literally universe shattering.\\n\\n&gt;And again, you are assuming that people are bothered because of changes alone (which again, aren\\'t logical most often and go against established facts, which would personally piss me off), \\n\\nNo, I\\'m assuming that people are bothered by the changes, and coming up with convenient reasons for why they aren\\'t only upset by these changes. Or maybe they are upset because of the changes, and also the bad writing/etc. But given the history of comics, and how often exactly the same changes have happened before and are either accepted or excused, it becomes very suspect when people can\\'t come to terms with changes that don\\'t pander to them.\\n\\nOne amazing example of this is your insistence that new changes should be \"logical\" and not go against \"existing facts\". Logical changes are not exactly necessary when you\\'re dealing with comics, and infact there is an incredibly long history of comics making incredibly illogical choices and justifications in order to placate their customers. Pandering.\\n\\nAnd as far as existing facts are concerned, comics practically invented retconing entire universes of lore in order to get rid of some baggage, enter into a new story line, or correct the path of a story.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t like illogical changes and dismissal of extablished facts, then you don\\'t like (or are totally ignorant of) the history of comics.\\n\\n&gt;The rest, for example Spiderman I put to show that they have changed too, which (given the thread we are in), I would call exactly what\\'s in part of the title: pandering. \\n\\nBut they **HAVE\"NT CHANGED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** Thor has not changed, they are exploring a story arc in the same way they have done several times before. Iron man hasn\\'t changed,  they are exploring a story arc in the same way they have done several times before. Spiderman hasn\\'t changed their are several series of spiderman with variations on the character running simultaneously.\\n\\nAnd even if they all had changed, this is absolutely nothing new or unusual in the comics world.\\n\\n&gt;You can argue that people \\'being represented\\' is a good thing, and it is - as long it brings them money. \\n\\nIt\\'s neither a good thing nor a bad thing, it\\'s an inevitability of reality. \\n\\n&gt;https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/26/diversity-marvel-concerned/\\n\\nThis kinda reinforces my point? That the changes being made are par for the course in comics (trying ideas and story lines and then returning back to basics) \\n\\n&gt;Also, Thor: https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3437920/thor3.0.png\\n\\nYa got me! it happened in a tongue in check thought to herself. Clearly this is cold hard evidence that feminazis have taken over all of comic books and that women should only expect to see stories about women by women in special women only comic books.\\n\\n&gt;... It\\'s fantasy dude/person.\\n\\nThat is low hanging wish fulfillment pandering to boys. Why is it ok to \"pander\" to boys and white folk, but not to do it for black folk?\\n\\n&gt;I find this to be a bad assumption, though certainly there are, and the same goes for everything else. You are also assuming that all comics are like that, and that some that get through aren\\'t from people who simply enjoy creating their own worlds and characters. \\n\\nI don\\'t understand what you\\'re trying to say here...\\n\\n&gt;To say that x character\\'s race has to be this, and x sexuality has to be this is shitty, \\n\\nThen why are you defending the notion? You\\'re saying that thor *can\\'t* be a woman. The people \"leaving comics\" are the ones who are saying that x character can\\'t be this or that...\\n\\n&gt;and while I agree to a point it\\'s necessary at times, others get to \\'cater\\' to themselves as long they are PoC/etc, without such things being forced into their stories. \\n\\nAgain, White mainstream audiences have been catering to themselves for the entire history of media. Why is it only \"catering\" when POC or minorities do it? Why is it only \"forcing\" when POC do it?\\n\\n&gt;That\\'s okay. I don\\'t mind using SJW because I know, and I assume most that know enough about them, aren\\'t referring to them as people (I\\'m sure they are fine enough) but what they try to stand for. The same goes with feminists; I find their actions more important than what they say, and who they are as human beings isn\\'t my concern, nor I\\'m insinuating in any way they are \\'bad\\' people.\\n\\nCool. If you\\'re ok with poisoning your own goals, and actively participating in eedless jerk-offery and idealogical jackassery then you go right ahead.\\n\\n&gt;Seems like you don\\'t know them all that much and their awesome goalpost moving abilities :P\\n\\nI know plenty about people who are far more invested in signalling their virtue and debating in bad faith.

Do you care to expand on that thought?\\n\\n&gt;\"You get get it elsewhere\", imo, is important because most Americans seems to overlook such markets - especially because of subtitles/language. \\n\\nThat could be true, but I fail to see what it has to do with the topic at hand: Representation in mainstream american culture, and labeling efforts to increase representation being labeled as \"pandering\" while ignoring the fact that the lack of representation is due to exactly the same kind of pandering..\\n\\n&gt;Depends how you look on it. Do I have an issue they are including a gay character? Not really. Do I have an issue they are advertising it that way? \\n\\nWhat do you mean by advertising it? I understand that they have stated that there is going to be a gay character. I\\'ve yet to see any advertisements from the producers themselves trumpeting the arrival of a space gay as though it\\'s the second coming of gay christ. I did find this:\\n\\n&gt;and he confirmed that the series would feature at least one openly gay character, explaining that Kurtzman had been the first to propose the series include a gay character, but that Fuller, who is gay himself, had been determined to create a gay Star Trek character since receiving hate mail while working on Voyager when a character on that show was rumored to be coming out as gay.[31] At this time, Fuller had discussed the casting of the series with Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space\\n\\nSo the people who are excited to see star trek begin to reflect the reality of a world in which sexuality, race and planet of origin are all par for the course are getting \"pandered\" to and \"advertising it\" but the people who right angry letters about maintaining the status quoe in response to a *rumor* are not?\\n\\n&gt;Because it didn\\'t work out. Not every change is a good one, not every storyline is a good one. \\n\\nI never said differently. I\\'m pointing out that the changes you are currently seeing are no different than changes that have been made in the past and are no more \"pandering\" now than they were then\\n\\n&gt;You said they are poorly written. \\n\\nI was unclear, and I apologize. What I should have said is that poor writing and comics are not strangers, and like all of you other complaints are well represented in the history of comics and in some cases held in high regard despite the poorness of the writing.\\n\\n&gt;The authors often, that actually do care about things they create, do their best to make sure they are written good. \\n\\nI\\'ve not said otherwise.\\n\\n&gt;The rest from what I understood, when you said that (and the rest of the stuff), you seem to assume that content is created to pander to people \\n\\nI\\'m using your own language in order to prove a point. I do\\'t believe that content is solely created to pander to people nor do I believe that pandering is really involved at all. The point I\\'ve made several times now and you\\'ve glossed over or ignored is that if including diverse sets of characters in response to audience desires counts as pandering, then so does *excluding* POC in response to audience desires.\\n\\n&gt;Take it this way: If I write about a green, lesbian character from another world, that came to Earth and started fighting feminism, taking on feminazis, as you put it, day in day out, and then one day I decided to change the fact that the character is lesbian, and make it straight, that the character is green, and make it blue, that she was all along actually a he (and not in a trans kind of way), and no longer wants to fight feminism, but identifies with it, that\\'s... huh, whole lot of change. \\n\\nThe analogy doesn\\'t track. To my knowledge such a complete reversal of all characteristics and motivations hasn\\'t happened. Lady thor **isn\\'t** the polar opposite of thor. Black lady iron man isn\\'t the polar opposite of tony stark. The new spidermen **aren\\'t** dour, completely serious villians fighting against all of the things spiderman has fought for. They are just different versions of the character (or position) with different genders/skin tone and a different story.\\n\\n &gt;Pointed out. \\n\\nWhere?\\n\\n&gt;And now you\\'re a mind reader XD \\n\\nI\\'m not a mind reader. I have been around long enough to know that if someone is determined to engage in rhetoric, name calling, binary thinking, us vs them bullshittery of most stupid internet arguments, then such a person is much more concerned with making themselves feel correct (but only in opposition to something they think they hate) than they are in engaging in honest discourse.\\n\\nI don\\'t care about changing minds or whatever, I care about elevating yourself and the level of discourse you wish to engage in. If it is your wish to invoke useless, self congratulatory pejoratives like SJW, that\\'s fine. But it only lowers your credibility, and hurts your argument. It is absolutely possible (and quite preferable) to have discussions without invoking ideological boogeymen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "   '\\nSo, as an American, I view the US as being fairly diverse population wise. Other Western nations less so (I\\'m not exactly sure of the demographics; it\\'s just an assumption on my part), but I imagine as time goes on, populations in Western nations are going to become more and more mixed. I view multiculturalism as a good thing, regardless of where it is. \\n\\n&gt; I don\\'t know. From artists, white people included, it\\'s sort of expected to create content for everyone - every race, sex, etc, and that seems a bit crazy to me. Why should they be allowed creative freedom? Why it\\'s fine PoC create content that suits them, but everyone else has to think of PoC as well - and you can swap that with gender, or basically anything else people complain about nowadays.\\n\\nI had a conversation with a guy a long while ago about something similar. I don\\'t think anyone can - and should - be forced to be inclusive. But I was questioning, (on the basis of race), why it is that a white creator would choose, either consciously or unconsciously, to only include white people in their creations. Because, if this is true:\\n\\n&gt; Most don\\'t really give a damn, imo. I\\'ve played a bunch of characters, and couldn\\'t give a damn about race\\n&gt; \\n\\nWouldn\\'t straight/white creators automatically be including PoC and sexual minorities in their work without thinking? That\\'s how it works for me. As I mentioned in my original post, \"minority\" racial features to me (be they wide noses, full lips, eyes with epicanthic folds, kinky/coily hair) I choose as simply as I would choose eye color or hair color. I grew up with a diverse friend group. (Adam Ellis probably did as well, or at least he has a diverse friend group now, which is why he has so many PoC in his comics). I get the idea that if you are writing about the real world, racial populations are often focused in particular areas, yet there are creators creating Sci-Fi or fantasy who will only include white casts. (Sure, you can have the excuse that you\\'re basing your fantasy world off of a European nation, but if you were to do that and make the cast completely Asian, or black, or Amerindian, I\\'m sure you\\'d face some backlash from another group entirely). Sci-Fi, without sufficient explanation, has little excuse for an all-white cast, given that by the time humans take to the stars, It would make sense that we were mixed to hell and back again. \\n\\nThe answer the guy gave me was that he\\'d grown up around white people, had most of his positive interactions with white people, and saw white people in media. This brings me back to my point that I made using the example of Uhura from *Star Trek*. Minority characters aren\\'t just there to appeal to minorities - representation is extremely important for that reason (see the Mae Jemison example) but also because it influences non-minorities (straight/white/cis/etc.) to associate minorities with positive characters/characteristics. More representation eventually ends the cycle of under-representation because those non-minorities who grow up to be people of influence, creators or not, are more likely to be inclusive due to the influence of minority characters.\\n\\nIf a PoC creator creates a show or a movie or a book with majority PoC characters, for example, black filmmakers creating black films, it\\'s likely not going to be noticed by the majority. If an influential white creator who is already established creates a show with PoC characters, I\\'d argue it is more likely to be noticed by the majority (this sort of goes back to the example I gave about book covers; books with PoC characters having white faces on the cover to make them \"appeal\" more, which has actually happened). \\n\\nIf white people, who are currently the majority in the West, did not care about race, the creators, without thinking, would have characters with a gamut of skin-tones and hair textures and facial features. We\\'d, arguably, see more fantasy that wasn\\'t based in Europe (or less often but still popular, East Asia), or even if it was based in Europe, the characters wouldn\\'t be 100% white (imo, if you have a world filled with magic and non-human races, having humans with dark skin isn\\'t unrealistic). \\n\\nI get that this is somewhat more complex with live-action stuff, as often the right person to play the role may just be the right person to play the role\\n \\nIf a straight guy/lesbian author were to describe every woman in their book as having huge breasts, a huge ass, and a tiny waist, we\\'d roll our eyes and maybe accuse him/her of pandering.  Women (and men) have diverse body types.  But when the author describes everyone in their fantasy novel as pale or tan, there was once little criticism of it. \\n\\nAgain, people shouldn\\'t be forced to do anything they don\\'t want to do. If you want to only create stuff about white people, that\\'s your prerogative. But I disagree that creators who have exclusively white casts in their work, or have a couple of \"token\" minorities, or if they have a diverse cast, the leader is still white (I\\'d note this as pandering), don\\'t care about race. I, again, think inclusiveness will only influence more people in the majority to be inclusive as our Western world becomes more multicultural.\\n\\nTo address your point about white creators being held to a higher standard than PoC creators, I think the reasoning behind it is something I touched on a bit. White creators, especially established white creators, are seen to have more influence because they are members of the majority, which is why people may have higher expectations toward them. \\n\\n&gt; Most don\\'t really give a damn, imo. I\\'ve played a bunch of characters, and couldn\\'t give a damn about race\\n&gt; \\n\\n\\nTwo things. 1) Just because you, as a player, don\\'t care about race (or maybe sexuality) doesn\\'t mean the creators don\\'t care. I was joking with a friend about how popular the Witcher series would be if Geralt was gay--(I watched a Let\\'s Play of the first and haven\\'t got around to playing the second or the third)--and all those steamy sex scenes and shots of naked women were instead with men. I wondered if people would feel as emotionally about *the Last of Us* if Ellie had been a black or Hispanic girl (There were PoC in *the Last of Us*, so it wouldn\\'t have been unrealistic to have one of the two main characters be one). Otherwise, the games would be exactly the same, and both games/series are pretty loved. Given the vast majority of Western video game heroes are straight white men, can we not assume the devs are \"pandering\" to their majority because they fear the reactions might not be the same otherwise? \\n\\n2)  I\\'m assuming you\\'re a white guy -- I could be wrong. If you are a white guy, you kind of have the ability to not care, because you will be represented anyway. Even if you choose to play Eastern games, you can come back to Western games and see \"people like you\" everywhere. I grew up playing lots of games and watching lots of shows and movies with white protagonists. While it didn\\'t necessarily bother me, I can\\'t tell you how excited and relieved I was when there WAS a character like me (a black, or at least dark-skinned girl). I latched onto those few examples as tightly as I could, especially when they were shown as capable and powerful and self-sufficient. (Two examples of childhood role models -- the character Amanra from *Age of Mythology*, and Princess Kida from Disney\\'s *Atlantis*). \\n\\nI\\'m not saying every single PoC or every sexual minority cares, but visiting subs where PoC or LGBT+ people congregate, I see excitement for representation. There was hubub in the LGBT sub when Blizzard released a comic about the character Tracer from *Overwatch* being gay (or at least bi). It matters to minorities. [Here is a link to a study on how positive representation matters to children](https://experts.umich.edu/en/publications/racial-and-gender-differences-in-the-relationship-between-childre). \\n\\n\\n&gt; Also, this is a small example what content creators have to go through if they\\'ve done \\'wrong\\', according to some: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/zamii070-harassment-controversy\\n\\nI don\\'t think anyone, EVER should be harassed or \"forced\" to be inclusive.  I was aware of the Zaimii controversy. That is fucked to hell and back. As someone with mental illness and suicidality, I fear putting my work out there for similar reasons. \\n\\nDeath threats and other harassment are not criticism, just sick. But constructive criticism of someone for lack of diversity is just as valid in my opinion as any other constructive criticism. And that does not make the output of someone accepting that criticism-- creating a more diverse cast of characters -- harmful. Because, to me, it\\'s up to the audience to connect with a character and interpret meaning. You could just casually choose to make your main character dark-skinned with an afro, and if your book/movie/whatever becomes popular, she could end up a symbol and role-model for dark-skinned girls with natural hair everywhere. Again, from what I\\'ve read, the Star Trek creators actively made a choice to have more racial diversity, and we see the influence Uhura and Sulu had on people. I\\'m curious what influenced the Star Trek creators to make that choice.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure I like the BAFTA thing; I\\'m not a fan of \"force\" in place of constructive criticism and suggestion. \\n\\nI do think there are people who hate white people/white men and want to exclude them for past crimes today\\'s individuals haven\\'t even committed. However, I do not think that\\'s a large portion of people who are pushing for diversity. As a content creator (writing, game dev), diversity to me certainly doesn\\'t mean \"no white people\". And I think the majority of liberal/PoC content creators think the same. I think most people advocating for diversity are not advocating for discrimination in the opposite direction by excluding members of the majority completely. Some are, but that\\'s, in my opinion, not what diversity means or is about.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Many people, including some academics, would go as far as to call our school system close to antithetical to intellectual growth and maturity. The current school system is often accused of still being essentially the factory model of education - disputable, but it certainly still has some problematic commonalities.\\n\\nThe humanities courses in standard school curriculum are often wasting time not helping students understand these subjects in a way that\\'s engaging and relevant to life, they\\'re \"teaching to tests\" as people like to say. There are exceptions but often it\\'s just a good teacher making the best of bad curriculum. For me personally, what I remember most is that I spent a lot of time on rote memorization of dates and names, body parts and chemicals, etc. etc., with lots of terribly dull worksheets. And I think this is extremely common. It\\'s not that some of that particular knowledge is worthless, but without more context students just forget them after they serve their purpose(which, without context, is just getting a good grade on a test).\\n\\nHistory and biology obviously are valuable subjects independent from the curriculum, but what\\'s valuable about them I think more often than not isn\\'t being taught in the curriculum. And let\\'s face it, economics is part of history as well, and any well-rounded understanding of the last few centuries would have to involve teaching some economic ideas. \\n\\nWe also don\\'t even teach civics or critical thinking....in a representative democracy. (At least not as core subjects, maybe some have them as electives? Mine didn\\'t.) There\\'s almost no philosophical foundation for better understanding these subjects in a way conducive to intellectual growth. They\\'re taught more as a list of things to memorize for your test. And I could go on a long rant about how awful the history curriculum is when it comes to avoiding almost everything interesting in history in favor of an American-centric and mostly PG rated narrative. \\n\\nI think the argument that we should make school more practical is probably too concerned with replacing these subjects, but the thing is these subjects are being taught in such a dry and useless way that right now we certainly would be better served by courses more practical for managing day to day life. Ideally perhaps, we\\'d have a school system that can do both. ',\n",

For example, if you try to cover what the different current parties represent, a conservative teacher will present the stances of the liberal parties in a different and light than what a liberal teacher might and vice versa.

I think the important thing is that we teach critical thinking enough that students have some tools to navigate things on their own, and that we draw the line when it comes to certain empirical facts - a science class shouldn't introduce religious beliefs as science, but a religious class could introduce those religious ideas.\\n\\nI also think unfortunately in some universities the politicizing extends to all classes now, not just particular ones like social justice or gender studies or whatever, depending of course on university. This is partly due to activism putting pressure on the administration and so there are things like sensitivity courses for teachers, and some teachers will even go as far as putting spins on current events before teaching their actual subject.\\n\\nI don't think that this is a good thing, and it's far more problematic due to universities being utterly dominated by liberals for various reasons, but the other extreme where we try to minimize any politicizing isn't feasible either.\",\n",

However, you have to understand that this is the first major example of corruption within Games Journalism that's really gone viral. Gamergate didn't start out merely because of the Zoe Quinn scandal, the Zoe Quinn scandal was what triggered an organized effort of disenfranchisement, active accusations of misogyny from the media against gamers, long public twitter shootouts, etc. Zoe Quinn, Phil Fish and other notables, alongside a veritable cartel of games journalists all took a united stand to silence and publicly slander anyone who wanted to talk about the Zoe Quinn scandal. Dozens of sites deleted any mention of the issue, and any discussion on the matter. This led to GamerGate.\\n\\nThis issue is no longer about just the Zoe Quinn scandal, but due to the backlash any attempts to even talk about it met, has evolved into an indictment of an industry that many feel no longer represents the interests of the consumer, and no longer stands for any kind of reasonable standard of basic integrity.\\n\\nThe Sarkeesian and Quinn rhetoric would have us accept that it's wrong for video games and for gamers as a medium to continue the misrepresentation of women, but ultimately is trying to achieve this goal by misrepresenting gamers as misogynists. In my experience, GamerGaters are staunch supporters of equality and respectful treatment of all people, but don't care for the method by which this clique is attempting to advance their rhetoric.\\n\\nAnyone who doesn't agree in full with this new wave of Gaming SJW reasoning, or anyone who attempts to moderate a message they feel is extreme is labeled a misogynist. There is an active attempt right now to co-opt gaming journalism, and there is an active campaign of us-vs-them rhetoric taking the gaming community by storm. It's polarizing, it's divisive, and it's ultimately unproductive.\\n\\nAre there negative stereotypes of women in the gaming industry? Sure. Are there misogynists who play games? Sure. Is there a significant he-man woman haters' club that has evolved because of the gaming world being so exclusively male for so long? Absolutely, but simply attempting to silence your opponents by seizing the moral high ground and bullying those whose views you are trying to change is just going to further cement opposition to you. Not only that, but it's going to convince people that would otherwise stand by you, that you aren't worth allying with.\\n\\nGamergate is about more than who Zoe Quinn did or did not sleep with, and about more than the way Phil Fish won his awards. It's broader message is that we feel that there is a group of people in the industry at the moment whose views on the subject are so polarizing and extreme that they are poisoning and fracturing an environment whose sole focus should be fun.\\n\\nTL;DR: If someone respectfully disagrees with your opinion, and you are unwilling, or unable to respond to their disagreement in any other way than calling them a racist/a homophobe/a misogynist, you are a charlatan and deserve no credit for having a rational argument.

This led to GamerGate.\\n\\nSee, this is where the problem lies:\\n\\n1) The accusations of misogyny and public twitter shootouts *were a direct result of the reactions people made to the blog post from Erin Gjonji.* Because a cursory examination of the evidence would prove that the accusations involved in the Zoe Quinn post had no merit and were completely untrue. As such, people became convinced of some sort of conspiracy to not cover the story by games journalist publications *despite the fact that none of the accusations were true and it should have stayed as a private situation between two people*. The reason why gaming publications weren\\'t covering it was *because there was nothing to cover*. \\n\\n2) as a result of the misogynistic reactions and slut shaming that came out of the complaints about Zoe Quinn and the fact that she was doxxed and her information was disseminated across the internet along with trading of nude photos of her, harassment, etc. Gaming publications rightfully called out the gamers who were doing this. The articles about the \"death of the gamer identity\" are, in essence, celebrations of the success of gaming, arguing that it is now enjoyed by so many people of such diverse backgrounds and with such varied interests that the idea of the gamer—a person whose identity is formed around a universally enjoyed leisure activity—now seems as quaint as the idea of the moviegoer.

The fact is that instead of focusing on *actual corruption like they are claiming* they are focusing on individual developers who, in this case, have actually done nothing wrong and have not been part of any corruption whatsoever. In particular attacking them with misogynistic harassment.\\n\\n&gt; The Sarkeesian and Quinn rhetoric would have us accept that it\\'s wrong for video games and for gamers as a medium to continue the misrepresentation of women, but ultimately is trying to achieve this goal by misrepresenting gamers as misogynists. \\n\\nThe GamerGate movement has done more to represent gamers as misogynists than any individual person or article. Seriously, the longer this drags out the more it portrays gamers as misogynistic. Sarkeesian\\'s videos *do not claim that gamers are misogynists*. They say \"these are elements in our games which are misogynist and misrepresent women\".

There is an active attempt right now to co-opt gaming journalism, and there is an active campaign of us-vs-them rhetoric taking the gaming community by storm. It\\'s polarizing, it\\'s divisive, and it\\'s ultimately unproductive.\\n\\nExcept that there is no active attempt at co-opting gaming journalism, excepting of course for GamerGate.

I see a few gaming publications publishing articles pointing out sexism and misogyny in gaming and gamers saying \"NO NO NO, there\\'s no misogyny in our games! so there!\" If anything, GamerGate is itself an attempt at bullying journalists. The demands for journalistic integrity coming from Gamergate have nothing at all to do with the systemic corruption of the gaming media. They\\'ve centered instead on journalists purportedly pursuing social-justice agendas and on ridiculous claims that the press sees gamers as vectors of social contagion. Some of the complaints, like the idea that outlets ought to reconsider their editorial positions if enough readers disagree with them, even stand in direct opposition to traditional journalistic ethics.\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s broader message is that we feel that there is a group of people in the industry at the moment whose views on the subject are so polarizing and extreme that they are poisoning and fracturing an environment whose sole focus should be fun.\\n\\nThis is the issue. Right here. The people you claim are poisoning the environment? Are saying \"hey, why can\\'t we make this environment *also fun for people who aren\\'t white males*?\" And the fracturing happened because of a small vocal group of people who say \"No, don\\'t change our stuff! We like our sexy objectified women and sex workers and majority male protagonists!\" The only reason why gamers think that the views are \"polarizing and extreme\" is because other people who simply *do not like the views* have claimed they are extreme and want to impose them on games have managed to convince other people that they are right.\\n\\nSo far the only opinions that I see harming gaming, are those espoused by GamerGate.',\n",

So the entire argument put forth is that somehow, a bunch of gaming publications covering sexism in games is proof of a huge conspiracy against gamers?

I think that us gamers thought we were superior (because it made us feel better when were young) and now confronting the reality that 1) this isn\\'t true and 2) that the people who used to bully us are now standing beside us wanting to enjoy our stuff, has confused many people.\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s completely disgusting to see the modern gaming media just pull a blatant 180 like that and post socially conscious browbeating and condemnation on their prior audience the minute they realize that there\\'s money to be had in the pockets of the more socially conscientious.\\n\\ncould it instead be possible that new writers actually *agree* with the socially conscious stuff and were afraid to post in the past because of this type of reaction and it\\'s only been recently they\\'ve realized that they can survive while posting it or even more *finally got fed up with letting it slide*?\\n\\n&gt; What I do want, however, is for gaming journalism to develop a more professional attitude, and to understand that they can\\'t just dump fuel on the fire, then blame the fire brigade for water damage.\\n\\nI don\\'t understand this view though. Gaming journalists were reporting on the events as they happened. They reported on the huge harassment of Zoe Quinn and when people didn\\'t like that (the conspiracy theory about covering up a non-existent corruption) they believed they couldn\\'t trust the gaming journalists. The problem is not that the journalists have an agenda, the problem is that they have \"the wrong\" agenda in your mind.\\n',\n",

       "   'Anti-Islamic sentiment mostly stems from racism. You\\'ll note that when people who are white do something heinous, no one blames all white people, or large groups of them. For example Timothy McVeigh\\'s rampage didn\\'t result in society claiming that Christians are violent. Yet we see again and again with non-white people that the actions of a few are extended to label the larger group. A few young black criminals results in blaming \"black culture\" for example. As such, the vast majority of Muslims are middle Eastern and most anti Islamic sentiment is centered on racial slurs and bigotry.\\n\\nEspecially when you consider that Mahr was explicitly claiming it was the culture of the people in Islamic countries rather than the religion itself.

Which is pretty explicitly racist.\\n\\nYet in the countries he was talking about, there is widespread public approval for the murder of people who criticize Islam.\\n\\nIn the countries he was talking about, there is widespread public approval for the murder of people who leave the faith.\\n\\nIn the countries he was talking about, there is widespread public approval for the stoning of women who have extramarital sex.\\n\\nYes, there are places like Quatar, Yemen, Oman, Turkey, and Malaysia where there have been significant strides toward modernism and secular morality.\\n\\nMarr\\'s point is that the issue rests in the cultural reliance on Islam as a fountain of ethics, and not that it\\'s a racial issue at all. His point is that the countries where there are horrible atrocities going on, there is also a strong social undercurrent of religious extremism. I\\'m sure his commentary on Turkey, Morocco, Malaysia, or Indonesia would be much more moderate than his commentary on the parts of the world that right now are calling for Muslims to rise up and demand the heads of any who stand in the way of Islam.\\n\\nThis is exactly the point I was making. You are far too quick to jump to the bigotry card. Marr wants to see the world a better place through the moderation of Islam, and through reasonable discourse on the subject --although, maybe with some irreverence and levity thrown in. Christianity was a horrible force for human slaughter for a very long time, but eventually the enlightenment occurred, and forced it to moderate. Arabia was also once a hotspot of intellectual activity, of peace and prosperity, and europeans were barbarians by comparison. However, that all changed when science and mathematics were declared evil by the Clerics of the day.\\n\\nPointing out the problems with a culture is not racism. Blaming those problems explicitly on racial differences alone, however, is racism. Marr in no way stated: *\"Those arabs/persians/afghans aren\\'t capable of ruling themselves\"*. He\\'s saying: *\"These are major cultural and ideological problems, and if we can\\'t address the issue without being called bigots, the problem is going to continue to spread and affect all of us.\"*\\n\\n&gt; For example Timothy McVeigh\\'s rampage didn\\'t result in society claiming that Christians are violent.\\n\\nNobody is doing that. Atheists will argue that religious-motivated violence is excused and often justified by a cursory reading of the bible. They will argue quite the same in regard to the Qur\\'an and the Hadith. Criticizing the actions of extremists, and the doctrine of the religion is not broad-brushing the whole.\\n\\nYes, there are people who argue against Muslims as though they are \"brown scary people\". Yes, there\\'s an undercurrent of bigotry surrounding them in the west. However, **there are legitimate discussions to be had, and sweeping away legitimate criticism by pointing out the illegitimate criticism does not serve to further the narrative and actually help anyone**.\\n\\n\\nWe live in a society that\\'s just woken up to a global discourse. For the first time, our species is actually looking itself in the mirror. Our ability to converse with one another, to share thoughts, and to criticize and challenge each other\\'s deeply held beliefs is what is going to reinvent our species.\\n\\nYour argument is essentially that it is xenophobic to attempt to affect change from without. If we take your approach, and ignore other cultures\\' harmful beliefs, if we stop the discourse, it will set us back to where we were before we started this: disparate cultures whose views and beliefs cannot be reconciled with one another.',\n",

To blame Islam itself for this is bigotry. To blame \"all muslims\" for this or \"the culture of Muslims\" as if it is a singular entity and culture, is bigotry. \\n\\n&gt; Marr\\'s point is that the issue rests in the cultural reliance on Islam as a fountain of ethics, and not that it\\'s a racial issue at all. His point is that the countries where there are horrible atrocities going on, there is also a strong social undercurrent of religious extremism\\n\\nAnd yet we see these same issues exist in non-Islamic countries too! Hell, we see horrible atrocities going on in countries that aren\\'t even religiously extremist. The point is that to blame Islam, Muslims in general, or to lump them all into one singular culture *is bigotry* and is completely useless for discussion. The issues in Quatar are not the same as the issues in Iran which are not the same as the issues in Pakistan. \\n\\nThe problem is that you’re talking about a religion of one and a half billion people and certainly it becomes very easy to just simply paint them all with a single brush by saying, ‘Well in Saudi Arabia women can’t drive,’ and saying that’s representative of Islam. That’s representative of Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n&gt; Pointing out the problems with a culture is not racism.\\n\\nLumping a bunch of disparate cultures all together because they share the same race....is racism and is exactly what he did. He looked at all the arab countries, declared the various social issues to be a product of Islamic extremism, and lumped them all together into one thing. He can try to point to the \"culture and ideological problems\" all he likes, but he\\'s lumping billions of people with diverse disparate cultures, different beliefs, and ideologies all together and the only trait they share is their race. It\\'s the same as saying \"black people, you know, shoot each other\" and claiming that this is a cultural and ideological problem that needs to be solved.\\n\\n&gt; Criticizing the actions of extremists, and the doctrine of the religion is not broad-brushing the whole.\\n\\nBut the \"doctrine of the religion\" doesn\\'t match the actions of the extremists and thus to claim that the issue is anyone deriving their ethics *from the religion itself* is in the same boat as the extremists is fucking bigoted, especially when we can see millions of muslims who don\\'t follow any of the specific beliefs that are being pointed at as problematic and rather just pray several times a day and go to school.\\n\\n&gt; However, there are legitimate discussions to be had, and sweeping away legitimate criticism by pointing out the illegitimate criticism does not serve to further the narrative and actually help anyone.\\n\\nYou\\'re right, there are legitimate discussions to be had. But saying \"Islam is the only religion that acts like the mafia\" is not a legitimate discussion. No one is sweeping away legitimate criticism. They are saying that, in this case, Bill Maher\\'s criticism *was not legitimate*. If you want to criticize the culture of a particular country\\'s people and their treatment of women, then go ahead and do so! But don\\'t lump a whole bunch of different countries, people, and cultures together and treat them as the same. That\\'s not legitimate criticism.\\n\\nThe approach being put forth is not to \"ignore other culture\\'s harmful beliefs\". It\\'s to discuss the *particular culture who has harmful beliefs* and not lump extraneous people in simply because they share the same religion or race even though they don\\'t actually have the same cultural beliefs.',\n",

I don\\'t have an interest in your opinion on Islam as a religion, nor Islam as a state religion. You very probably don\\'t have enough of an insight into these regions to speak on them. I do.*\\n\\nThe purpose of this religious tangent is that I wanted to prove my point: That you are only using emotional reasoning. You want to be able to label people as bigots and dismiss them without any valid argumentation, and you are willing to contradict yourself to do it.\\n\\n**You just quite literally contradicted yourself, by stating that one simultaneously can condemn an entire group of people, and that you can\\'t, based on a few bad apples.**',\n",
       "   '&gt; You just quite literally contradicted yourself, by stating that one simultaneously can condemn an entire group of people, and that you can\\'t, based on a few bad apples.\\n\\nYea, no. If you want to oversimplify you can claim that, but there was no contradiction in my statements. You may have a point if I had, at any point, said that \"all pro-GamerGate people are misogynists\" or \"every one supporting GamerGate is scum\". But at no point did I say that. The thing you are quoting from me was stating that the label of GamerGate is too linked to the misogyny. The fact of the matter is that for any public view *the only experience they see of GamerGate is the misogyny and harassment*. Period. \\n\\nUnless you\\'re actively debating someone, or part of the movement, the only cohesive message that GamerGate has assembled is to point at a supposed conspiracy of journalism corruption that didn\\'t exist and harass multiple women. There has been no message put out into the public outside of this. The public face and association of GamerGate is this harassment and incompetence.\\n\\nIt\\'s not like a religion which has billions of practictioners many of whom belong to Mosks which have publicly and clearly denounced the terrorism (guess what: GamerGate has not publicly and clearly denounced the trolls, harassers, and misogynists because no one can claim to speak for the movement and as such everyone who claims to be associated is associated). There\\'s a significant difference between a leaderless social movement with no central dogma, message, or organization and an organized religion with tons of officiants, practicioners, and a central dogma. \\n\\nI\\'m not using emotional reasoning, or label and dismissing people without valid argumentation (I actually agree that corruption in games journalism should be addressed....the actual cases of corruption with companies paying for review scores and coverage, not small insignificant events of a single developer\\'s life and how she provably didn\\'t sleep with journalists for positive coverage). If GamerGate wants to be taken seriously, then they should *actually address actual corruption in games journalism* instead of continuing to harass developers. And we\\'re not talking about \"a few bad apples\" but rather several thousand of them. \\n\\nUltimately, you haven\\'t proven any contradiction because you\\'re attacking a strawman. I never said that \"All GamerGaters are X\". I said that at this point, the label of GamerGate is too polluted in the public mind to be rescued because after months of existence, the only thing that can be publicly attributable to GamerGate is the harassment, threats, and misogyny campaigning against a few women developers.',\n",

This is despite the fact that, from what I have seen of their videos and articles, I don\\'t agree with their assessment on the current state of women in games and the game industry.\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing.  Condemning harassment and threats is all well and good.  But those threats and harassment happen because Quinn, Sarkeesian, Wu, and others have been deemed *the enemy.*  They are accused of attacking \"games\", the issue is characterized as a battle or war.  Until that sort of rhetoric stops characterizing GG it will continue to be used as a cover for harassers, because you will continue to agree on the ends but not the means.\\n\\n&gt; The fact that the allegations were later proven false isn\\'t the point: the point is that there wasn\\'t even a hint in that review that there was some pre-existing relationship (and I personally don\\'t believe that they started a relationship from \"Hi, I\\'m reviewing your game\" to \"LET US HAVE THE SEX!\" in like the 2 weeks that there was between the review and the relationships, but I also admittedly don\\'t have any data either way.) and that if that could go completely unnoticed and only be revealed when some jaded ex posted chatlogs, what else could be going on that isn\\'t turned up at all, that could cause conflicts of interest?\\n\\nAs I said in another thread here, this is all factually wrong.\\n\\n[A pro-GG poster submitted this as the \"positive press\" that Grayson gave to Depression Quest.](http://i.imgur.com/MRrvoPO.png)  Note, it was written in January 2014, and is not a review but merely a mention that the game is on Greenlight and is a critical darling (which was true.)  But even Eron, the ex who started all of this, [acknowledged that there was no relationship between Quinn and Grayson until April of that year.](http://geekparty.com/eron-gjoni-clarifies-the-zoe-quinn-nathan-grayson-timeline/)  There is no pre-existing relationship.\\n\\nAlso, despite all that, I\\'ve gone from meeting someone for the first time to having sex with them in 2 weeks a number of times.  It\\'s not that unusual.  And [Grayson denied that there was a close relationship between him and Quinn as of the end of March.](http://geekparty.com/how-i-know-zoe-quinn-did-not-exchange-sex-for-a-game-review/)  All the allegations of impropriety are wrong.

The best written law or social stricture can't possibly anticipate what will happen hundreds of years from it's writing. The reason we have to go back and forth about what 'arms' means in the 2nd Amendment is that, when the law was written, there were no tanks, no automatic weapons, and no atomic bombs. When the Bill of Rights was adopted, 'arms' meant muzzle-loading flintlock rifles and pistols. It would be ridiculous to say that the right to bear arms is restricted to these weapons because that was the norm when the law was written.\\n\\nLook at your argument from that angle: the right to bear arms (when it was codified into law) applied to single-shot, muzzle-loading, flintlock weapons. You're not denying anyone the right to bear arms by restricting that right to the weapons that were traditionally available at that time. Anyone who wants to own a single-shot, muzzle-loading, flintlock weapon has the ability to do so. Anyone who wants to own another type of weapon is attempting to redefine the definition of 'arms' from its traditional meaning. \\n\\nYou can do this with all sorts of rights. Freedom of the press was exclusively physical print up until the advent of radio. Where does the internet factor into that? Freedom of religion in the US meant freedom of Christian denomination, according to the Founders. Freedom from cruel and unusual punishment is still being debated, but has definitely come to exclude execution though hanging or firing squad.

       "   \"&gt;Trump has said two kinds of things concerning race: outright racist things (Mexican immigrants are rapists), and things so ambiguous and devoid of value that they don't indicate anything about his true views. A betting man would conclude that he's a racist, or at least tolerant of racist policies.\\n\\nThe former was not said, again that's a projection (often perpetuated liberal media outlets) upon an ambiguous statement regarding the potential criminality of illegal immigrants. The latter doesn't imply racism even if it's construed that way by racists. That leap is my confusion.\\n\\n&gt;His personal opinions before he became interested in politics are completely irrelevant. \\n\\nGiven the theatrical nature of his campaign, they're a more reliable bellwether for his true beliefs.\",\n",
       "   '&gt; The former was not said\\n\\nWhat do you mean? He literally said it in his announcement for presidency. [I quote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/):\\n\\n&gt; When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\\n\\nI don\\'t understand how you could deny he said this. No one is projecting anything - he said the exact statement in a public speech. Calling immigrants rapists is not \"an ambiguous statement regarding potential criminality.\"\\n\\nPlease don\\'t take this the wrong way, but if you\\'re not willing to acknowledge basic facts about Trump, I\\'m not sure you\\'re willing to have your mind changed about him. I hope I\\'m wrong about that, though.\\n\\n&gt; The latter doesn\\'t imply racism even if it\\'s construed that way by racists\\n\\nLet me explain it from a different perspective (rather than repeat the same point in different words): Bernie Sanders has made it normal to talk about socialism in national politics. This is significant because before his campaign, it was anathema to even mention the word socialism, much less wear it as a badge of honor. By repeatedly advocating for policies identified as socialist, and repeatedly bringing it up and defending it, Sanders has shifted what is acceptable to talk about in politics so that socialism is now fair game.\\n\\nTrump has done something remarkably similar with racism. By repeatedly making comments that are easily construed as racist, by repeatedly supporting policies that disproportionately affect people of certain races and ethnicities (build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, make a database of all Muslims, deport all refugees, etc.), Trump has made it acceptable for politicians at the national level to be racist.\\n\\nNote that it doesn\\'t matter how many excuses you come up with for why he doesn\\'t *actually* believe statement X, or why statement Y was distorted by the \"liberal media.\" None of those excuses change the fact that his statements have made it much more acceptable to say racist things and support racist policies.\\n\\nAnd he knows this. He intended this. He wants to make racism OK because it makes it easier for his racist supporters to rally behind him. Because of his \"theatrical\" campaign, we don\\'t know any of his personal opinions. But we do know that he\\'s so OK with racism that he\\'s willing to normalize it to gain more supporters. He\\'s so fine with making racism more normal that he\\'ll use it as a campaign strategy. That\\'s racist. Really, really racist.',\n",
       "   '&gt;I don\\'t understand how you could deny he said this. No one is projecting anything - he said the exact statement in a public speech. Calling immigrants rapists is not \"an ambiguous statement regarding potential criminality.\"\\n\\nBut the data cited in the WaPo article appears to confirm that some illegal immigrants from Mexico are rapists and some are good people. The article also seems to exclude the number of unauthorized aliens deported in its total tallies. In any case, it\\'s obvious his quoted statement is flexible enough to attach any distracting agenda to (as is frequently done) but the underlying issue is not about race, it\\'s that \"a nation without borders or laws is not a nation\".\\n\\n&gt; But we do know that he\\'s so OK with racism that he\\'s willing to normalize it to gain more supporters. He\\'s so fine with making racism more normal that he\\'ll use it as a campaign strategy. That\\'s racist. Really, really racist.\\n\\nYou say Sanders has made it acceptable to *discuss* socialism, but Trump has made it acceptable to *be* racist. It\\'s not like he has conjured up a new racist segment of society, whatever elements choose to support him -- even for the wrong reasons -- already existed. \\n\\nIf anything, hasn\\'t Trump just made it more acceptable to *discuss* racism, which should be a positive? A country will never solve its problems without being able to openly talk about them.\\n\\nYou appear to be suggesting that not immediately dismissing a viewpoint indicates some kind of tacit approval for it. I just don\\'t see how that holds or is productive in any way.',\n",
       "   'Last post, in reference to his statement on Mexican immigrants, you said\\n\\n&gt; The former was not said\\n\\nNow, you\\'re agree that it *was* said. Your new justification is that his statement true, but not actually racist? It sounds like you\\'re trying to defend him rather than discuss him objectively. Can I ask what kind of evidence would it take for you to change your mind about what kind of person he is?\\n\\n&gt; You say Sanders has made it acceptable to discuss socialism, but Trump has made it acceptable to be racist\\n\\nLet me rephrase it to be clearer: Sanders has made it acceptable to espouse socialist, and Trump has made it acceptable to espouse racist views. In Sanders\\' case, socialism was so taboo that it was difficult to even discuss it, but in Trump\\'s case, racism was not so taboo that it couldn\\'t be discussed; Trump has just made it easier to argue in favor of racist ideas.\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s not like he has conjured up a new racist segment of society, whatever elements choose to support him -- even for the wrong reasons -- already existed.\\n\\nBut they didn\\'t have as much of a voice in politics before he legitimized their racism. Imagine that a politician normalized the views of the Westboro Baptist Church to the point that it was acceptable to preach their message in public forums. It wouldn\\'t matter that the politician didn\\'t create the WBC. What would matter is that this politician let them spread their toxic views much further than they would otherwise be able to.\\n\\n&gt; If anything, hasn\\'t Trump just made it more acceptable to discuss racism, which should be a positive?\\n\\nNo, we\\'ve been discussing racism in this country for well over a century. Trump didn\\'t make it more acceptable to discuss racism, he made it more acceptable to *espouse* racism. Productive discussions on racism don\\'t involve questioning whether or not we should be racist. Only fools believe that certain races are superior to others. Productive discussions center on how to deal with racism.\\n\\nTrump has not added to discussions on how to deal with racism because he isn\\'t discussing the harms of racism or solutions to those harms. He\\'s actively supporting and proposing policies that only racists would be in favor of. When people try to call him out on these comments, he and his supporters come up with 100 reasons why he\\'s not *technically* racist and how he was just \"stirring the pot\" or \"asking questions\" or any other justification that misses the point: his policies do not add to discussions of racism, they promote racism and give a voice to toxic people.\\n\\n&gt; You appear to be suggesting that not immediately dismissing a viewpoint indicates some kind of tacit approval for it\\n\\nNot at all. If Trump never mentioned race or racism in any of his speeches, there would no problem. There are many issues for politicians to tackle and racism is just one of them; not everyone needs to talk about it. But Trump has repeatedly brought race into his speeches and every time he does, his statements come off either overtly or subtly racist.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t have to literally say \"Mexicans are inferior\" for his statements to be racist. Above, you argued that since some Mexican immigrants are rapists, his statement about them being rapists is technically true. That misses the point completely. **Every culture, nationality, race, and religion contains rapists.** Pointing to a specific nationality and accusing them of being rapists is an attempt to incite racial hatred.\\n\\nThievery is common. Every race of people is full of thieves. Making the statement \"black people are thieves\" because *some* black people are thieves is racist because it takes a race-neutral issue (thievery) and turns it into a racial one. Trump isn\\'t doing this by accident. He\\'s not clueless about race politics. He knew that by claiming Mexican immigrants are rapists, he would give racists a rallying point. He knew that news cycles would be full of people debating the issue back and forth: \"*are* Mexicans rapists? More on this at 5\"\\n\\nBut giving two sides to a clearly one sided issue is a terrible decision. It gives toxic extremists a microphone and with the internet, an easy way to rally together. Even though 9 out of 10 people don\\'t believe for a second that Mexican immigrants are any more likely to be rapists than anyone else, now the news is full of 50/50 discussions on the matter. Those 1/10 racists now feel like they are part of the majority, like their views are normal and acceptable and debatable. Their views aren\\'t debatable; we had that debate decades ago and decided to treat people equally. Pretending that this decision is still up for debate sets back civil rights because now instead of dealing with actual issues, we\\'re wasting all of our media attention entertaining the toxic delusions of racists.',\n",

The fact that a conspiracy could stay hidden is trivially true. A number of motivations and mechanisms are easy to imagine. such a number in fact that that it would be functionally impossible to rule them all out by investigation.\\n\\nAs reasonable humans though, we have to dismiss things that we can\\'t disprove.

The protect the public being duty number one is not in my view to protect the people from themselves but to protect the group from other groups.

I as an individual can say I am going to live here and to live requires that I secure for myself shelter, food, and water in the very least. Other individuals also have those same basic need to meet and if I don't protect my means of keeping those basic things someone else can just come and take it. \\n\\nGroups of people form so that the individual don't have to work as hard to keep those means of survival so that instead of just focusing on those things they can then become more enabled.

You group up with others so you don't have to spend all of your time on basic survival because others can help you and help to keep you protected and safe so that you then can focus your efforts onto enabling yourself to do whatever it is that you feel you can do. \\n\\nI suppose my whole view is based on protection is governments responsibility, and enableing myself is my own. \\n\\nI do see what you mean and would agree that really boundaries are silly and they should fall away, but it will be a long time in the future before that happens if it ever does. I think that because there will always be someone out there who thinks there way of doing things is better than yours and others will agree thus you will have at least two big groups or governments. Resources are limited and some places on earth are better than others so its basically always going to be at least two kids in a sand box fighting over the one dump truck toy. If humanity ever is able to get rid of those boundary's and come together as one group you would first have to make sure everyone has what they need and has no desire to have what someone else has.

Other factors decide how far the rights go (and there\\'s WAY more debate), but the basic \"having the right to have rights\" comes from having will. Higher animals have wills. Amoebae, bacteria, jellyfish and earthworms don\\'t. The middle ground is blurrier, but we can lump most invertebrates there.\\n\\n* Additionally we have emotional attachment justified evolutively by *resource amortization*. The pain of losing a child is greater than that of losing a parent, because many resources go to waste. Resource amortization starts kicking in before a child is even conceived, if it\\'s planned parenthood. That\\'s why miscarriages result painful.

Are pre-implantation *in vitro* conceived embryos morally worth less than *in vivo* conceived ones?\\n\\n&gt; but it relates more to the concept of \"self\" than the concept of what is \"human\".\\n\\n\"Human\" means \"a member of the Homo sapiens\" species, and we accorded that non-human individuals can apply. Could you please use another term? Even if it\\'s a long one, we can use m-entity (for \"moral entity\") for short afterwards.\\n\\n&gt; how exactly does one determine when a fetus has sufficient \"will\" to be characterized as a human?\\n\\nI consider it a human since the moment of conception, but I don\\'t place much burden in that concept. Since the point it remembers and reacts to stimuli more than as a reflex, I consider it to be entitled to have rights, although most of the \"rights\" come from the mother\\'s will.\\n\\nOnce it\\'s viable and has enough moral value by itself (still at the level of just a complex mammal), the rights it has depend on what others will (similar to how you wouldn\\'t shoot a healthy abandoned animal if someone is asking to take care of it, but stronger).\\n\\n&gt; This is the crux of the issue, and not somewhere where discussion can lead us to common ground.\\n\\nAs you said, with different premises we arrive to the different conclusions.\\n\\n&gt; It seems to me that this distinction will certainly be arbitrary.\\n\\nTo me it\\'s blurry in many points, but it\\'s also consistent (there\\'s some gaps, but doesn\\'t contradict itself), emotionally acceptable to me (I would feel sad about a 7-month fetus killed, but not about an early embryo) and practical (most abortions take place where I find it acceptable).\\n\\nMy intention in stating my views was mostly clarity anyway.',\n",

So, that\\'s cool! 2008 was the exact same number as the high end of pre-Roe v Wade! And, in addition, the pre- numbers likely aren\\'t including a lot of unreported ones! Neat!',\n",

Either way, I don\\'t understand how you think 800,000(the actual estimate from your link) and 1.21 million are the same number. 1.21 million is 1.5 times the number of abortions as pre-Roe v. Wade.

The paramedics inside scream at you \"LOOK, THE GUY IN HERE WAS JUST IN A CAR CRASH, AND UNLESS WE PLUG YOUR ORGANS INTO HIS BODY AND YOU\\'RE LINKED TO HIM FOR THE NEXT 9 MONTHS STRAIGHT, MAYBE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE\". Is it considered murder if you tell them to fuck off? No? Why? Because of you, this guy died, because you didn\\'t wanna turn your life into \"be linked to this random guy you don\\'t care about\" until you die. Why is this situation so different? Hell, it\\'s very easy to argue it\\'s *worse* than abortion to turn down the paramedics, because this is an actual, living, sentient person. He has memories, family, friends, everything. A fetus has none of those.\\n\\nSo clearly, if abortion is wrong, you should be required to engage in this theoretical situation if it ever comes up, right?\\n\\n&gt;Either way, I don\\'t understand how you think 800,000(the actual estimate from your link) and 1.21 million are the same number. \\n\\nIf you read that article, you\\'d see those are from two different studies. One determined it ranged from 200K to 1.21 million, while another said it averaged 800K per year.

No? Why?\\n\\nThis is simple. One, you are not responsible for the condition of this man. You are responsible for the condition of the fetus you created when you had sex.

For shooters? Mouse/keyboard wins all day. But there are plenty of genres where a controller is better (racing games come to mind immediately).\\n\\n**The price of entry**\\n\\nThis is really debatable unless you ignore console optimization and just look at tech specs. I just finished building my first dedicated gaming PC a few months ago and on paper it will handily blow a PS4/Xbone out of the water but after optimization the difference is relatively negligable. Considering how much Xbox 360 games improved in the past 8 years, I'm looking at at least double the cost of a PS4 to have something that can outperform it at the end of this coming gen's product cycle.\\n\\nAnd that's not even including the time spent researching what all to buy and putting the thing together. That's time that some gamers don't want to spend when they can hook up a brand new console in 5 minutes.\\n\\n**The ability to mod games**\\n\\nThis swings both ways (bots, hacks, etc.) Some people see those issues as a bigger deal than beneficial mods. Again, it's subjective.\\n\\n**The ability to pirate games**\\n\\nThis is a really mixed bag as well. (again, *subjective*) Piracy is a whole lot easier on PC but DRM is a lot more annoying (Origins). Plus there's the issue of delayed releases and console exclusives. Sure there's PC exclusives as well, but that's another *subjective* decision. PC gamers are still waiting for GTA5 and Red Dead Redemption because (allegedly) Rock Star doesn't want to go through all the work of porting their games (something they're clearly not great at) just to have so many people pirate it. [Check out the Skyrim sales breakdown by platform](http://www.statisticbrain.com/skyrim-the-elder-scrolls-v-statistics/). Xbox 360 outsold PC 4 to 1. PS3 outsold PC nearly 2 to 1. And how many of those people do you think bought Skyrim for super cheap like a Steam sale? Compare that to how many 360/PS3 owners paid $60 or more for the game. It makes solid business sense for game developers to release games for PC later than for consoles so regardless of your opinion on piracy, you're only shooting your own cause in the foot by advocating it.\\n\\nLook I'm not saying the PC isn't subjectively better for you than consoles. It is for me. I'm saying that your preferences determined that, which is why comparing PC's to consoles is really apples to oranges in the first place.\",\n",

       "  'comments': [\"This is a fairly common topic in CMV. I'm guessing you haven't done a search for this? Most of these points have been addressed in other threads. Give me a moment and I'll look for some comments I've made in the past about this and edit this comment.\\n\\nEDIT: I noticed you mentioned a few other things that I will need to address.\\nEDIT2: You haven't provided the sources for your studies. I have seen adoption studies that have shown equal IQs between the races. I typically don't ask for sources, but because you are making scientific claims I am going to have to ask that you link them.\\n\\nSimply put, if you take the IQ scores of blacks and whites, blacks score lower than whites by about 15 points.\\n\\nThis statistic of course, doesn't take into account anything other than race. Let's go through why most of the academic community isn't concerned about this.\\n\\n1) The gap we see here is not at all unique. There have been *many* instances of populations of people with lower than average IQ that have closed the gap entirely.\\n\\nFor example, women used to score far lower than men on IQ tests. This is no longer the case since women have gotten more educated. In this case, [we are starting to see the IQs of women surpass those of men (in general)]\\n(http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/16/why-women-finally-have-higher-iqs-than-men/)].\\n\\nAnother example is the IQ data gathered from East and West Germany prior to unification. East and West Germans were / are genetically indistinguishable, but there was a gap between the two reaching 17 points in some areas. If you take IQ as being mostly genetic, these results are highly problematic.\\n\\nA third example (and I could go on for longer but this is already long enough) is the [Flynn effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) This is the well documented phenomenon that observes populations IQs rising as they develop economically. The average black person today gets the same score as the average white person did in the US in the year 1950. The average black person's score is 15 points *higher* than the average white person just 100 short years ago. Unless you think there was a major genetic change in whites in the past 50-100 years, the rise in scores (for both races) was due to environmental changes. Whites have simply enjoyed a higher standard of living (then and now) which leads to them having environments more conducive to learning.\\n\\nI know I said that was the last example I'd give, but let me do one more because I think it illustrates my point. Another big difference in IQ scores can be seen between northern Americans and Americans in the South. In fact, there have been studies done where blacks in the north scored higher on IQ tests than whites in the south. Are northerners different genetically than southerners? If not, then why the difference? If we accept whatever that difference is, why are you not using that to explain the black - white difference?\\n\\nThe above examples give pause to the idea that IQs for groups are set in stone (they 100% are not and that's a fact), and that genetics are the primary determination of a persons cognitive ability.\\n\\n2) IQ scores only measure one type of intelligence (poorly)\\n\\nIQ scores can only measure one type of intelligence, and it doesn't even do that as well as we'd like. IQ tests don't accurately measure strategic intelligence, or even creative intelligence. \\n\\nThis is a huge problem since these forms of intelligence that the IQ tests cannot measure are some of the most important. Creativity lies at the soul of every major invention. It lies in the soul of every song, movie or play. Similar things can be said of strategic thinking.\\n\\nWould we think worse of people like Jimi Hendrix and Ghengis Khan if we found out they scored low on an IQ test. If we would, we probably shouldn't.\\n\\n3) IQ scores cannot measure potential\\n\\nThere are certain types of questions asked on IQ tests that you can get better at with practice. For example, pattern recognition and memorization are two things you can improve on drastically throughout your life (if you practice). This has two problems. One, it gives advantages to people who do similar kinds of thinking activities daily (this explains some of the Flynn effect we discussed earlier). Two, we may mistake someone had a low genetic limit based on someone not normally having to perform those kinds of activities, or not having as good of tools throughout their lives. Here is someone discussing this [here](https://youtu.be/9vpqilhW9uI?t=2m17s).\\n\\n4) At this point people will often say that when you control for certain variables the differences don't entirely disappear. For one, the differences fall away quite rapidly once you start controlling for things (income and neighborhoods mostly). Second, we have no way of controlling for *other* things that effect IQ testing scores.\\n\\nOne such example is [Stereotype Threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat). This is a phenomena that we've seen in not only IQ scores, but in math, reading, sports and (essentially) any other area where a stereotype exists. Stereotype threat is the phenomena that shows people perform worse if there is a fear that they will further a certain stereotype about themselves. The presence of this cannot be totally corrected for (although it can be manipulated somewhat).\\n\\nAnother example is cultural differences. We know that there are many ways that different races raise their children that influence their cognitive development. I really want to wrap this up, but one such example is the [word gap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/16/the-famous-word-gap-doesnt-hurt-only-the-young-it-affects-many-educators-too/).\\n\",\n",

Obviously, there is a genetic component to intelligence: I am smarter than my dog, and the only thing separating us is genetics. Equally obviously, there are broad genetic trends within a race - some ethnic groups are statistically taller, shorter, broader, different facial structure, predisposition to disease, etc.\\n\\nAdditionaly, different ethic groups have evolved under vastly different circumstances, so natural selection would reward different traits. Different groups abandoned the hunter-gatherer lifestyle at different points, if they did at all; different groups lived in societies that were more or less specialized, with greater or less class mobility. All of these factors influence how much intelligence (and specific kinds of intelligence) would be rewarded compared with other genetic traits.\\n\\nGiven all of that, it seems to be highly unlikely that there wouldn\\'t be a difference in intelligence between different ethnicities. Just in terms of the science, it seems to me like the burden of proof should be on those claiming equality, not those refuting it.\\n\\n(I should be careful to be precise about that last statement: I\\'m claiming that it makes sense that there IS a difference, not that the difference is in a particular direction between any two races. Think of it like... rolling a white six-sided die and a black six-sided die.

Someone who is \"black\" in the US, for example, may not be \"black\" in Brazil, and \"black\" actually encompasses a lot of different ancestry groups to begin with. \\n\\nAdding to this, we also have a problem in that we actually haven\\'t ever identified any particular genes which are different between races and correlate with intelligence.

In traditional taxonomic studies, the boundaries were defined by morphological differences, but now these boundaries are typically defined in terms of genetic differences that can be scored in an objective fashion in all species. Most demes or local populations within a species show some degree of genetic differentiation from other local populations, by having either some unique alleles or at least different frequencies of alleles. \\n\\n[Here](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070) is the requisite genetic differentiation:\\n\\n&gt;Examination of the relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.\\n\\nCome up with whatever term you'd like for these genetic clusters.\",\n",

For the record, interviews themselves aren\\'t a 100% reliable way of getting to know a candidate, nor is a resume, nor is any other resource short of hiring the person and seeing how they perform on the job. Does that mean we shouldn\\'t do any of that? No, because we need to work with what we have. For the most part, companies are privately held businesses aimed at maximizing their profit margins. They have no incentive to hire someone who gives off warning signals of any sort, whether it be through a poorly posted Facebook picture, or a controversial blog post illustrating poor personal judgement. Could this person turn out to be great for the job? Sure, but why would I take the risk and hire this person over another who had the same qualifications but a much fewer warning signals?\\n\\nThe other thing to consider is that most reasonable people on the job market will understand that they will be judged somewhat by their public profile on social media or whatever pops up on a cursory Google search. Doing a search on yourself or making sure that the more egregious photos of you on Facebook aren\\'t available is a relatively simple task, and as a hypothetical hiring manager, if a prospective candidate doesn\\'t make any attempts to hiring curate this, I\\'d assume one of several things:\\n\\n1) This candidate is lazy, and didn\\'t put as much effort as he/she could have in his/her job search\\n2) This candidate is inherently high risk because of A, B, or C that I found on his/her public profile\\n3) This candidate thinks that he/she is entitled to a job, and therefore didn\\'t bother to clean any of this up\\n4) This candidate is expressing himself/herself and could still be a decent fit for the company.\\n\\nI have no reason to assume the best. In most cases, I\\'d opt to assume the worst, since passing up a candidate who -could- be great at his job is significantly more worth it to me than hiring someone giving off a multitude of warning signs and ends up costing the company a hefty sum in legal fees, or being utter trash at his job, or otherwise being a net negative hire.\\n\\nI\\'ve rambled a bit, but the main takeaway is that companies have no obligation to consider you personally when hiring, they\\'d generally rather miss out on a \"possibly\" good hire than hire an utter disaster, and I have no reason to give you the benefit of the doubt when I see possibly objectionable content when I search for a prospective new hire\\'s online presence.']},\n",

It mustn\\'t. The qualia *is* the first-line identity of information that evolution evolved us to experience so that we could feel the differences between.\\n\\n\\nNo doubt the subject also brings internal incoming data from the brain to the mind that can influence the external qualia experienced!

Taking dogs away from their mothers too early creates all kinds of social problems, as well as health issues, later in life!\" (Midwest Animal ResQ)\\n\\nIt is true that these teacup animals are bred from the smallest of each liter, but because they are worth so much money, breeders are using many questionable and unethical methods of breeding to obtain as many of these teacup animals as possible. Even simply breeding to runts of two separate litters together can cause severe health issues to the babies as well as the mothers. Furthermore, speeding up this process has led many breeders to impregnate their animals at extremely early ages to increase the likelihood of premature births and smaller litters. \\nMore extreme cases have lead to starvation of mothers and babies to keep the animals as small as possible. This leads to many health issues and even death.\\n\\nThe issues with these dogs begin before they are even born. Teacup dogs can naturally occur as “runts of the litter,” but more often they’re the product of intentionally breeding two undersized dogs. Because the mother dog is so small, she can only whelp a couple of puppies at most and there’s a greatly increased chance of complications. In other words, breeding teacups is extra risky for both the mother and the puppies.\\nThat’s not the worst of it though. Because the dogs are in high demand and can sell for thousands of dollars, there’s a huge incentive for unethical breeders to produce these dogs any way they can.

That would tend to mean that textualists don't like to try and set new precedent with their rulings and prefer laws be decided by the legislature (which lets be honest, that's actually the legislatures job, and not that of the courts). Where as living constitutionalists prefer to set precedents that may change interpretations of laws or outright nullify them. There tends to be a lot of merit in both views, but I would note that the concept of judical restraint is INCREDIBLY important to a working legal system. The judiciary is by far the most powerful branch of the government legally speaking, and the power of judicial review gives them drastically more strength than any other branch. If an activist judge were to make a bad ruling (IE Plessy Vs Ferguson, or Dred Scott) that can have radical meanings for our government for a long long time, so the least precedent setting by the courts tends to free up society to change more naturally. Yet in the same way the reverse holds. Sometimes it takes making precedent to change society. Basically its a delicate balance that needs both sides to keep each other from excess or poor choice.\\n\\n(basically with great power comes great responsibility)\"]},\n",

       "  'comments': ['&gt; * 6,000 judges were removed within hours of the \\'coup\\', along with 8,000 police officers and 3,000 soldiers were arrested. I don\\'t think it\\'s in any way plausible that a country with even a well-oiled civil service and bureaucracy could put together these lists that quickly, let alone a country like Turkey. Therefore the lists must have been drawn up before hand.\\n\\nLists were not prepared quickly. It\\'s not a secret that [Gulen movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BClen_movement) infiltrated nearly every area of the state, and no-one knows that better than Erdogan, who were very close with Gulen and his team until 3 years ago. They were brothers in arms, fighting against the secular state. Erdogan brought the public vote and popularity, Gulen provided the manpower: He had many schools (many now closed) and had a team of very well educated people (at least when compared to the rest of the country) to hold public/military/judicial offices. It was indeed Erdogan who helped Gulen supporters to get to the positions they were holding until recently. The anti-secularist alliance of Erdogan and Gulen soured once they reached their initial aim, and then they turned to each other. Disagreements over who will control which offices resulted in government crackdown on schools of Gulen movement on 2013, and escalated ever since. More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_government_%E2%80%93_G%C3%BClen_Movement_conflict). First Gulen schools were shut, then newspapers, TV stations, banks, and members in police. It was widely reported Gulen\\'s last bastion was in judiciary and military. So, no, lists were not prepared hastily - they were ready, waiting to be actioned. (Trouble is, the extent of infiltration is so large, replacing those Gulenist judges, commanders, jet pilots are a massive, massive task. Nearly impossible. But once they did what they did, there\\'s no other option). Some reports even suggest majority of the military officers who took part in the coup were going to be arrested on July 16, so they tried their chances earlier than planned, hence poor planning and execution. These were published on Turkish papers on [July 14](http://www.aydinlikgazete.com/turkiye/orduda-dev-sorusturma-h88284.html), but I don\\'t have translations. \\n\\n&gt; * \\'Rebel\\' pilots had Erdogan\\'s plane in their sights, but decided to let him fly back to Istanbul instead of shoot him down. Source: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-plot-insight-idUSKCN0ZX0Q9\\n\\n\\nFrom [The Aviationist](https://theaviationist.com/2016/07/18/exclusive-all-the-details-about-the-aerial-battle-over-turkey-during-the-military-coup/)\\n\\n*Coup F-16s searched for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s plane, TC-ATA around Istanbul to shoot it down. According to some media reports rebel TuAF F-16s had the plane in their sights: it’s unclear whether they had a real lock-on, rather that they probably were searching the sky for the Gulfstream IV.*\\n*Furthermore, TC-ATA used a callsign THY 8456 to disguise as a Turkish Airlines airplane (Turkish’s callsign is THY) and the risk of shooting down another plane, and losing credibility too, could be a factor affecting the coup’s F-16s to shot down his plane and kill Erdogan.*\\n\\n&gt; * The FaceTime interview. Erdogan appeared on national television via FaceTime on an iPhone, held by a TV presenter. This sounds exactly like the kind of thing dreamt up by a PR consultant who was trying to make Erdogan look as disconnected from events as possible. Nobody in an entire TV studio had access to a Macbook Pro and an HDMI cable? Not a chance.\\n\\nI see where you\\'re coming from, and there\\'s no evidence that can prove or disprove this. I can only say Erdogan I know isn\\'t the man of elaborate tricks like that or PR consultants. He doesn\\'t need to convince people, not his voters anyway. His devoted supporters trust and believe whatever he says, with proof or not. And he doesn\\'t care for the rest.\\n\\n&gt; * Nobody is clear who did stage this coup. Don\\'t coups usually have leaders? Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36829574\\n\\n\\nAt this stage perpetrators are [known](http://time.com/4410330/turkey-coup-recep-tayyip-erdogan-akin-ozturk/). That’s the [team](http://i.cdn.ensonhaber.com/resimler/diger/s_4699.jpg), all high rank generals. Are they going to deny it? Some already did, some definitely will, some might admit involvement to a certain degree. Still early to say. There will be sound evidence for many, from phone calls to confessions of lower rank commanders. Phones of captured soldiers show they had a [whatsapp group]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N3V5_-i8us) chat where they coordinated the coup; phone numbers, names and all are visible. Do I trust that a fair trial will take place? No. But that doesn’t mean it’s staged.\\n\\n\\n&gt; *  The timing. Who starts a coup at 9pm? Someone who wants to be on prime time TV and issue a call to arms to his followers, not someone who wants the country to wake up to a new leader. The latter stages a coup at 4am.\\n\\n\\nFor this one I have no sources, but it’s been reported that intelligence detected unusual activity at certain gendarmerie and air force units and informed the chief of general staff. Some of the perpetrators also appear to have a change in heart in the last minute and may have ratted, Whatsapp chat I mentioned above suggests they expected larger support which didn’t show up.\\n\\n&gt; * Erdogan\\'s record. He has a history of paranoia, clamping down on opposition and general authoritarian tendencies.\\n\\nI agree with the statement, but it doesn’t say much whether it’s staged or not. \\n\\n&gt; * The man Erdogan blames makes no sense. Fethullah Gulen is an exiled Muslim preacher and former ally of Erdogan.\\n\\n\\nI explained the Gulen – Erdogan relationship above. Gulen team isn’t the sole perpetrators, it appears they had support from a larger anti-Erdogan base from different groups within the military though.\\n\\n&gt; * The military are the guardians of Ataturk\\'s secularist legacy. How on earth would a preacher who hasn\\'t been in the country for three years end up commanding the actions of the secular military?\\n\\n\\nMilitary *used to be* the guardians of secularist legacy. Series of attacks on the secular military establishment [[1]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer_(coup_plan))][[2]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergenekon_(allegation))] led by Gulen’s judicial team and supported by Erdogan removed all secular commanders from the army, many prisoned; opening the gates of higher ranks for Gulen’s team in the military. After Gulen and Erdogan turned into each other on 2013, Erdogan ordered a re-trial, and secularist commanders were acquitted, but the damage was done. Seeds he planted in the military were now working against him.\\n\\nBesides the points you raised, one thing that convinced me that the coup is real deal was 1. the scale of the rebel attacks 2. where they attacked.\\n\\nErdogan, always wary of the power military holds, relies heavily on the police for power projection. Police in Turkey is seriously armed, and always on the government\\'s side. So it does not make any sense for him to bombard Police Special Ops HQ with F16 figther jets ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioSHL1WEAVw)). 47 policeman died in this attack. Very unnecessary and over the top for a \\'staged\\' coup. He could convince his supporters without this, he had the power to make all the arrests without bombarding his own forces, or ordering tanks to crush civilian cars near Bosphorus Bridge ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR9M1Atdbzs)). I know this doesn\\'t prove anything, but it\\'s just... too much. I think it\\'s on par with \"9/11 was inside job because US needed Iraqi oil\". US did react to the 9/11 by invading Iraq, exploiting its oil, but does that mean 9/11 was inside job? Nah. But that\\'s just me.\\n\\nEdit: I answered a few more questions on this, it\\'s [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4twhwz/turkey_to_temporarily_suspend_european_convention/d5lfb3u)',\n",

       "   '   Just wanted clarify a little thing I know the term Imam is used for Fetullah Gülen and his people are called a secular group most of the time but there is way more than that. I was sent to one of their study homes when i was a kid, around 13 years ago and they are way more systematic to be a simple group. \\n\\n   I was contacted after i went to a prep school for a trial test to check myself. First they called and talked to my parents (I was 12 at the time), told them they wanted to help me study out of the goodness in their heart for no money (these people aren\\'t working at the place mind you but they have my test scores and contact info). My parents are religious so they are like \"yaaay religious people AND they wanna teach the kids sure we\\'ll send him\". So i go to one of their homes close to my school where collage students are staying, 4-5 male pretty big house with furniture and equipment like laptops for each of them all paid by their \"Big Brothers\" in the organization. They pay for your stuff through collage, you teach the little kids that sorta deal and there were literally thousands of these homes in the country.\\n\\n   So me and 3 other kids start going to the house 3 days a week before schoold to study for 2-2,5 hours and they help us study. Around 3 weeks in they start pressuring us into subscribing to their newspaper \"Zaman\" for multiple subscriptions \"because these people are religious, they are our people and we should support them and it\\'s an AMAZING newspaper too\" i refused one of my friends caved in whatever we keep going. Then little by little they start teaching us about religion we pray before going to school (I missed some lessons because we had to pray and i couldn\\'t get to school in time), but as i said I\\'m from a mostly religious backround so my parents think it\\'s great. By the way my mom keeps sending them food and stuff because they are students who can\\'t cook so from their point of view everything is going perfect.\\n\\n   Fast forward 5 to months in, they want to talk pay our parents a visit in their home, I tell mine about it they are like \"yeah sure invite them to dinner\". So they talk to my parents about which prep school they gonna send me (at the time almost everbody at that age group went to a prep school at the last year of middle school to help you study for high school exam because out educations system is shit) but they want to send me to one of their own, they had 2 or 3, they want to send me to one of their rivals because it\\'s important to have people everywhere. But I had a %80 discount or something from a different one because of an exam i took so my parents want to send me to that one. They send me out of room talk some nothing different i keep going back to the study house. Praying time keeps getting longer they keep talking about how good their newspaper is usual stuff.\\n\\n   Around 6 months (2 of our 4 kid group got cut until this point by the way) in one of them came around my house called me to talk outside, so i go with this guy we talk he basically wants me to pressure my parents into sending me to the prep home they want. I basically said \"look i got discount from the place if you want me to go somewhere else you can pay for it and i\\'ll go\", I came back home talk to my parents about most of the stuff that\\'s been going on missing classes,newspaper propaganda ( my parents weren\\'t around much around those years for medicals reasons so we didn\\'t had a talk about these stuff before) and they get really mad. I don\\'t know if they had a talk with them about it but I never went back to that place.\\n\\n  The reason I wrote this stuff in length is because when foreign people are talking about that group they talk about them like a church group meeting on weekends while in reality they are way more complicated and systematic than that not just students to they get business man,teachers,policeman everybody you can think of roped in like that. So even though Fetullah Gülen is called Imam the organization is way more than a prayer group.\\n\\n  Now I know it\\'s irrelevant to what i wrote, I\\'m gonna just say what i think about the coup in case you want to have at least some opinion about the guy who wrote all this stuff. I don\\'t think coup was fake but I do believe Tayyip is using it to push for things without public backlash whereas he\\'d had to be way more careful about these thins before. Lastly while I don\\'t believe he made it happen i think there is at least %40 chance that he let it happen, he found out and just weakened the coup it in enough places to make sure it fails.',\n",

No one I know has any connection to it. \\n\\nI had previously held the opinion that the guy was merely a scapegoat for Erdogan, but the story you're telling me paints him more power-hungry like a cult leader. \\n\\nI'd be interested to hear your opinion on whether Gülen is behind the coup. It seems strange to me that both Erdogan and the persons behind the coup were religious, because from what I heard (I'm a graduate researcher who works with a few Turkish researchers) the biggest problem with Turkey was the slow shift away from secular government and increasing power being given to Erdogan. Why would someone want to orchestrate a coup just to implement more of the same Islamization that Erdogan was already doing?\\n\\nSeems to me like:\\n\\n1.) Gülen probably isn't responsible for the coup\\n\\n2.) Erdogan knows Gülen isn't responsible, but wants to take out Gülen's supporters anyways\\n\\n3.) Erdogan was tipped off about the coup before it started\",\n",
       "   'Well firstly Gulen\\'s group is more secular about their practices than Erdogans in this whole thing, like 10-15 years ago when you couldn\\'t go to schools or work in government facilities wearing hijab they said \"you can take your hijabs off to work or study\" to their people. \\n\\nThey are more financially focused than religious focused while holding onto their religion. Most of their work has always been about having strong people in society, for example while muslims has to pray five times a day (namaz) they were saying \"you don\\'t have to pray while working to blend in\"  to their people in military because military didn\\'t want religious people in their folds at the time.  Or they only worked with their own people for business to strengthen their own business, I know couple people that went from basically small business to multi million dollar businesses in the span of 4-5 years after joining them. \\n\\nAnother thing to remember is we never \"got\" democracy in Turkey. It\\'s always been the people at the top forcing their way to other people and putting their own people in the important positions because of their affiliations rather than their abilities. Even when military staged a coup before it was more about power than secularity of the government like in the last coup during 80\\'s they made  law saying anybody who were in the coup cannot be persecuted for what they did during the coup in terms of law,punishment or money (I\\'m not wording this well but it basically says whatever we got r did during that period cannot be investigated). \\n\\nSo Gulen movement started placing their people into government and military before Erdogan came into power but they had to do it discreetly. When Erdogan decided to run for government he didn\\'t have the support of any faction in the country religious or secular so he made a pact with Gulen movement. They backed him with their structure and people while he placed their people into the government and military legally or sometimes illegally (as in preferring them over people more qualified or firing qualified people to put them in their place). \\n\\nBut the thing he didn\\'t account for was Gulen movement got strong enough (or they thought they got strong enough) to replace him and still hold their own power. So they started battling Tayyip closed their schools Gulen\\'s tried to arrest his ministers ( tapes coming out about corruption) but he weaselled his way out of it and started pushing for more and more. Well the thing is you can\\'t just punish thousands of people and not have backlash, unless everybody thinks they are criminals. They suspended without pay around 21 thousand teacher this week for being part of the Gulen group nobody gave a shit. \\n\\nI think Erdogan had the list ready about most of the people in Gulen\\'s group but couldn\\'t do anything in bulk like he can because they were so many, so he was getting rid of them in small groups 20-15 for months now. Now that he has an excuse he can get rid of all of them not just high ranking ones in the organisation without much public backlash. \\n\\nThere are some news saying MIT (turkish intelligence) found out about the movement of the army previously in the day but the message got lost during transmission because of Gulen\\'s people. There were some commanders who cut their own tanks fuel cord to stop coup supporters from using them go outside or some municipalities parking their trucks in front of military bases or onto airstrips to prevent military movements. Or they were about the get rid of most of the military leaders who attempted the coup in couple months during regular military summit so they took their last chance. Or they were going to wait until 03:00 but intelligence report forced them to move faster. How many of these are true is impossible to know right now. \\n\\nBut what i think happened has two sides first Gulen group thought they would have more support because of the people who hate Erdogan in the country and military documented like events in Gezi Parkin. Erdogan on the other hand found out about the coup used his people to cripple most of the power it has and now using it to get rid of EVERYBODY who has a connection to Gulen group rather than only the people at the top.

It is plausible that Erdogan may have heard of it ahead of time, but probably just enough time to assess the situation (to find out who's behind this, who's in support, who's against, what can be done, which groups could be negotiated with, is fleeing to Greece an option etc.). A scenario in which he finds out a week/month in advance and allowed it all to happen so that he can benefit sounds unlikely, because things have gone too far for that.

[2,972,372](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1886) people voted, out of a population of around [35 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Population). This means that only about 8-9% of the UK population voted.\\n\\nSo this is a weak democracy, I wouldn\\'t really call it much of a democracy at all. But regardless, as you pointed out there was support for Irish home rule. Gladstone tried to pass a bill that would make that possible only to narrowly fail.\\n\\nIn 1895 there was another general election, this time with a whopping 12% of the populace voting! In 1896 Gladstone tried home rule again, made it through the house of commons and then was defeated by the wholly undemocratic house of lords.\\n\\nIf the UK political system had been properly democratic at that point home rule would have happened. The next attempt, following the removal of the power of the house of lords was only \"defeated\" in the sense of the *executive* halting everything for the outbreak of WW1.\\n\\nThe most important thing to me about what happened here is that the majority of people in the modern day republic wanted home rule. There was a democratic mandate that was ignored. Not a failure of democracy.\\n\\nWith that in mind, how is attacking the politicians fair? They voted for home rule on multiple occasions and were overruled by unfair means. And attacking politicians who voted against home rule would *also* be unfair, democracy has to allow both sides to be represented safely.\\n\\nPlus, your characterisation of the RIC seems to be effectively saying that they were all black and tans. Throughout most of the history of the RIC they were overwhelmingly native irish. Also, as a general principle that\\'s just absurd. The police are generally just civilians doing their jobs, they shouldn\\'t be the targets of violence for that.\\n\\nI would agree that fighting against an army during a war of independence, or an uprising against a dictator is fair.

The British system at the time was a unweighted wealth system typically leads to lower turnouts of the whole population. Nonetheless that was the system and in the system home rule won. Home Rule also had a lot of support among the lower class who couldn't vote. Also for the vote the wider United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland only the Ireland section matters, for this.  \\n  \\nThe 'technocratic' Lords is a topic for another CMV, personally I favour it slightly but it needs big reforms. But that was part of the British political system at the time and it is impossible to say that a democratic upper house would do this as if the upper house is democratic it would likely not be FPTP constituency so just because it passed the Commons doesn't mean it will pass the Lords.  \\n  \\nBy failure of democracy I mean that with 40 years of Home Rule each time the majority MPs 60-70/100 being home rule nothing came of it. Prior to the HRP Irelands MPs rarely went to Westminster (I believe the Slave Trade Acts were the only votes they turned up for, most being of the opinion Aye).  \\n  \\nI'm not saying they should've attacked IPP or HRP or INL or INF politicians, but the Lords who blocked it and the other MPs not of Ireland who blocked it. I was also meaning my CMV in a broad sense using the Irish Home Rule as an example. Another example here would be I'd have no problem with the African National Congress nor their armed wing MK led by Mandela killing the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa or other prominent apartheid politicians. My opinion is tat yes the Ulster-Scot should have a say, they live in the Isle of Ireland just like the Irish but the MP of Westminster shouldn't block the bill, it is an Irish matter on how they are governed not a British matter. For Imperial matters Aye but for Irish national matters Nay.  \\n  \\nThe RIC as a police for certainly didn't subscribe to the idea they should have the consent of the people to police there. The Catholic Irish in the countryside were often oppressed by the paramilitary. The RIC issued Carbines, dressed in green, used military ranks, the 'police' were kept separate from the community in barracks. While they weren't all Black and Tans the Black n Tans weren't too far off the standard officer.   \\n  \\nThe police in many regards are a pseudo military, at least in the senses for a civil war. In the recent clashes in Turkey it was often the police clashing with rouge military units. Also most counter terror (the people who'd likely fight the guerrillas) are from the civil side not the marital side. I did say it varies from situation and obviously the less bloodshed the happy the days but, ideally if a revolution had to be fought a deal with law enforcement that they'd be neutral to either side and the rebels agree the provisionally the states law (unless it is dictatorial) apply and the police will just continue to administer that leaving the army to fight the rebels. If the police were to take a hostile stance to the rebels, they are breaking the rule of law after all, then they are a legitimate target.   \\n  \\nIndeed the only time a civilian should ever die is in the unfortunate case of small arms (large arms which I would say is rpg and mortars to larger weapons shouldn't be used in a urban environment) collateral, you see a fellow shooting at your 100m down the road and return fire a round ricochets and kills a civilian sort of thing. Both sides should do their upmost to keep civilian casualties at the lowest and provide escape routes and temporary accommodation. Only willing combatants should be engaged and the international treaties around POWs and civilians should be adhered to. \"]},\n",

There is a thought experiment made by Wittgenstein that shows how what you mean by words/language actually has little to do with private ideas in your head.\\n\\t\\n\"Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \"beetle\". No one can look into anyone else\\'s box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle.—Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing.—But suppose the word \"beetle\" had a use in these people\\'s language?—If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty.\" -- Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations\\n\\t\\n2.  The point of this thought experiment is to show how what really determines the meaning of our words is communal usage. Words to not require us to ever have a true picture (or any picture) in our head to be meaningful in life, just like there doesn\\'t have to be any beetle in the box for \"beetle\" to mean the things (or nothing) that is in all the boxes. This is why we are able to effectively convey words without being able to rigidly define them. \"Private Language\" as a concept is only one game we play with language, and is dependent upon communal usage, the way we inherit the meaning in our language.\\n\\n3.  The language game of communication has little to do with whether one is empirical or not, empiricism being late to our language, and constructive-empiricism being even a latter game.\\n\\n4.  The language of our ancestors resembled speech-acts, i.e. the words were more like throwing a stone. They meant something because they caused someone to do something else rather than place an idea in the other\\'s head. The meaning of the word \"Water!\" changes if it is directive to bring someone water rather than to try and place the word in another\\'s head. We could imagine a language with one word--\"Water!\"--and two people. To those two within the language no particular idea needs to be communicated for the language to work, to be meaningful, but merely one of the people to bring the other water.\\n\\n5. \"Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.—The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.) Of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us so clearly. Especially when we are doing philosophy.\" -- Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations\\n\\n6. To only talk to constructive-empiricists is to limit communication to one grammar, one game, but there are other grammars, other games. Possibly an infinite amount (who knows? How can one check?). No one can see the limits of language since \"the limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\" This is the case because language shapes our perception of our world. -- Those who do not have a word for blue find it hard to see it: https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-couldn-t-even-see-the-colour-blue-until-modern-times-research-suggests\\n\\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11759-russian-speakers-get-the-blues/#.VPZtubOUdV8\\n\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/104/19/7780.full\\n\\n7.

The other part though, while many people like to argue because \"teaching a rapist not to rape is like teaching a murderer not to murder.\" This isn\\'t true. At all. Murder has and easy definition. (this is going in to your second point too) If they\\'re dead, and you caused it, guess what? You murdered them. The definition of rape; however, is very skewed. Because it\\'s such a taboo subject, and nobody will just fucking talk about it, nobody really knows what is and isn\\'t rape. \\n\\nJust last night, my brother and I were talking about it (he\\'s an 18 year old boy). He was arguing that something that happened in my book *wasn\\'t* rape, (even though all of the main characters agreed it was) so I asked him to describe a full scenario in which rape occurs. He then proceeds to describe one in which a man with a \"mask and a gun\" breaks into a girls house, forcefully pins her down, takes both of their clothes off, and rapes her. I told him a VERY small percentage of rapes are *actually* like that, and he wouldn\\'t believe me. I told him the rapist doesn\\'t need to even use physical force for it to be rape. He told me that I was wrong and it isn\\'t rape if there isn\\'t force used. \\n\\nNow, I know my brother isn\\'t the smartest, but he\\'s an average teenage boy who, like many others, has never been educated on the subject. He could very well end up a rapist and not even believe he is one. And you know why? Because no one will even talk about rape. Nobody will educate our damn youth on what\\'s crossing the line. The only people who really do (feminists) are frequently laughed at and not even taken seriously. That\\'s scary. So yes, we **can** \"teach boys not to rape.\"\\n\\nAs far as \"as long as you can move you\\'re responsible for your well being\" goes, consent does not mean there wasn\\'t a \"no\" or a fight, it means there was a clear \"yes.\" If a guy starts to make a move on a girl when they\\'re making out or something, and she\\'s so caught of guard that she freezes and and feels like she can\\'t say no, that\\'s rape, and the guy should know that unless she clearly says yes, or she\\'s enthusiastic and participating too, then it\\'s rape. Sure it kinda sucks for him, since he probably didn\\'t know what he was doing was bad, but that\\'s what you get when you live in a society that\\'s too afraid to talk about one of its biggest problems. If I don\\'t know downloading movies is illegal, but I download the entire Harry Potter series, should I be free of charge? No. It\\'s my responsibility to know the law. That being said, most drunk sex lacks consent because the drunk person is too out of it to say no or put up a fight. That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not rape.\\n\\nFor the record: the book that had rape in it was The Perks of Being a Wallflower. A boy and a girl were making out, he starts to do more, she says no and that she doesn\\'t want to, and starts to cry, and he just compliments her and guilts her into it anyway, after she clearly says no, and is crying, and she eventually gives in and does what he tells her to, still crying.

The job duties and pay are a far and much less emphasized second goal in this whole concept.  Now this may sound like I have an axe to grind with these low paying programs, but I don\\'t.

Goodwill wants workers to be able to hang 100 garments with no errors in 32 minutes. “We can’t do it that quickly because we can’t look at a garment and see the size,” she says about her experience and her husband’s.

       "  'comments': ['It\\'s most definitely not \"fake\". The outrage is very, very real. \\n\\n\\nIs the outrage justified? Certainly. He said that a 13 year old having sex with a mature adult could be a very positive experience. He\\'s implying that 13 year olds are mature enough to make rational sexual decisions, and sure, maybe some are, but most are not. This kind of talk normalizes sex with minors. He has a huge platform and a large audience and trying to put sex with a minor in a positive light, is a terrible use of that platform. It can encourage adults to pursue underaged boys and girls and these predators may feel justified in their endeavors. They may begin to convince themselves that not only is this behavior okay, but that it is a *good* thing and in no way harmful to the minor. It can lead to coercion or manipulation of naive young individuals, and anyone who encourages this kind of behavior should be shut down.\\n\\n\\nA lot of people say these kinds of things, yet opposers of milo only seem to care now that *he* has said something, therefore, they don\\'t really care at all, right? It\\'s all fake, right?\\n\\nNo. They would shun this type of speech from anyone. But would they have this much outrage if it were someone else?\\n\\nWell, probably not, but that depends on who it is saying these things. People tend to be less vocal when someone they support says something dangerous or insensitive, and they scream and shout when someone they oppose does the same thing. This is because, from their perspectives, they can rationalize and/or justify why \"their guy\" said such a thing and when given any kind of reason that can alleviate the internal conflict, they latch onto it with all they can. Confirmation bias also plays a huge role in this. As I am sure you are aware, a few weeks ago Milo was scheduled to make a speech at the UC Berkeley campus, but the event was canceled due to rioters. This was a HUGE loss for liberals because 1) it made them look bad. The media milked this event for all that they could to paint the left as whiny babies who are trying to take away free speech and throw tantrums by destroying property, despite the fact that the rioters acted separate from the protesters and represent a small, but extremist portion of the democratic base. 2) it made Milo look good. I believe his book orders went up by 1200% (?) over night because of this. Milo is already despised by the left, and seen as someone who does nothing but encourage divide and reinforce negative stereotypes about minorities. This event made leftists, who see themselves at the \\'good guys\\' appear to be the villains while a man they dread was seen as the hero. The brains reaction to this would be similar to losing a large some of money while gambling, or to being rejected or broken up with.\\n\\nThen comes along some videos and a stream of news coverage portraying Milo as the rotten scum of the earth they know him to be. After hearing this news the reaction in the brain would be a huge release of dopamine. Having your beliefs confirmed or reinforced is literally addicting and learning that a man you believe to be awful has had material released \"proving\" this belief (as well as the subsequent firing from his job and book release cancellation) validates his opposers greatly and pushes them deeper into their opposition. \\n\\nThe rage they feel about what Milo said is absolutely real, and it is absolutely justified, but is it really the words that are inciting all this rage, or is it the fact that *milo* said these words? Most likely the latter. It doesn\\'t mean they don\\'t truly think what he said was wrong, they already thought it was a bad thing to say, but that fact that those words came from Milos mouth makes them much, much louder. \\n\\ntl;dr \\n\\nIs the rage fake? No. It is real and it is justified, but that does not mean political bias does not play a huge role in fueling this fire. The people who are upset about Milo genuinely feel distaste towards him and about this situation. They are not \"pretending\" to be angered by someon implying sex with a minor is \"good\", but Milo having been the one to make these implications definitely acts as a magnifying glass to a rage that was already there. \\n',\n",

It could be lies, it could be mentally justifying an experience as a means of coping, but it could also just as likely be that your cousin and Milo genuinely feel this way. The reason people might assume Milo to be a liar could be because he makes a living off of being a provocateur. They see him as someone who says outrageous things to get publicity, and therefore might conclude that his statements regarding sex with a 13 year old were said as a way to selfishly gain publicity, and now that these comments have received a widespread negative backlash, Milo now is forced to justify his words. They feel his \"I\\'m a victim\" spiel or any other excuse he offers as to why he said what he did is a forced attempt to mediate any damage done to his image. It very well could be that he simply said something widely unpopular that he believed to be true, and then felt obligated to offer a better explanation and some context to his fans whom he may have disappointed. \\n\\nAssuming that he is telling the truth and he really does believe his sexual encounters were positive experiences, it needs to be understood that the same cannot be said for every minor who has had sexual relationships with older men and/or women, (and there is research out there that identifies the negative impacts of such relationships, as well as research that supports notion that minors are unable to consent to these types of relationships) which is why it is better to err on the side of caution and discourage these kinds of relationships.',\n",

       "   'First off, let me say that I am not acquainted with who Milo is, and I did not follow the outrage that the OP appears to be talking about. I am also not arguing whether the exact outrage is justified or not in this situation, the conclusion to which, to me, would mainly depend on how unproductive and uncivil it was. This is, once more, due to me not being aware of the details and having not followed the outrage. However, I may provide some exemplary situations in which an outrage would be justified or not, which are not representative of my opinion on the actual outrage that took place. I am also not suggesting or promoting any physical action inspired by the ideas below.\\n\\nHaving said that, I would like to refute some of the points you have brought up as I have reason to disagree with them. I am new to this subreddit, so I apologize if this is seen as off-topic or breaks any rules.\\n\\n\"He\\'s implying that 13 year olds are mature enough to make rational sexual decisions, and sure, maybe some are, but most are not.\"\\n\\nWhile I\\'m not going to delve into whether this is true for very young children, say, under 4 years old, I believe most adolescents are able to make sexual decisions with no problems. A 13 year old does not need to know the Gravitational Theory before they jump on a trampoline. To the same extent, a 13 year old does not need to know exactly how a sexual act takes place and the precise outcome of engaging in one before trying it.\\n\\nConsent to a sexual act is a process—after all, you do not ask your partner every time \"Do you consent to me touching your tongue with mine?\" to progress further after a light peck on the lips. You\\'re simply going to gently go in for a French kiss, and if your partner doesn\\'t like it, this indicates their withdrawal of consent, and a desire to stop the activity. Such body-language signalling is innate to humans and programmed at a basic level, so even children are able to display their willingness or lack thereof to engage in a sexual act. Just try forcing a kid to eat their vegetables—they are going to make it very clear that they aren\\'t enjoying it. Verbal communication is still there as well.\\n\\nHowever, a kid might be very eager indeed to taste some Doritos, and this is not different from their enthusiasm to engaging in sexual activities. If they are seeking this, they are going to be keen on learning about sexuality and naturally become better and more knowledgeable regarding the subject. I believe we should not try to thwart these desires and intentionally keep children in the dark about anything relating to sex, then proceeding to assert they are uninformed. \\n\\nOf course, all this requires the adult the child is interacting with to be reasonable and responsible. This is where I would like to utter a reminder about the distinction between pedophiles and rapists. A person who raped a child may not be a pedophile at all, and simply have a desire to assert control over weaker beings or some other motivation. I am not arguing in favor of these people. \\n\\nSimilarly, a pedophile may be attracted to children but not have sex with them for their whole life. A pedophile does not equal a rapist, and I don\\'t believe there to be any evidence for them being innately more inclined to commit such a crime. Anyone can be a pedophile, and many are nice and gentle people no different from you and me. Most will not want to harm their loved one and will endeavor to take proper measures to ensure the best experience for them. \\n\\n\"This kind of talk normalizes sex with minors. He has a huge platform and a large audience and trying to put sex with a minor in a positive light, is a terrible use of that platform.\"\\n\\nI am not aware of the exact statement that Milo made regarding this issue, but if it actively promoted having sex with minors in the current state of the world, then, I agree with the above quote. While there\\'s nothing inherently harmful about carefully practiced sex between an adult and a minor, the current societal climate in most first world countries does not allow for such acts to be assuredly harmless. There is a significant chance that the act being illegal can force a child to become unnecessarily secretive, and if the secret gets out, the sheer stigma surrounding pedophilia can turn it into a traumatic experience for the minor. Thus, I do not promote encouraging people to have sex with minors at the present time. \\n\\nOn the other hand, if all that Milo stated about this topic is that \"...a 13 year old having sex with a mature adult could be a very positive experience\", then, I do not believe I can condemn such a declaration. I agree, that even in face of the present societal issues surrounding pedophilia, a child, especially provided with proper support, can think of the experience as overall positive. In fact, there ARE adults who think of the sexual experiences they had with other adults as a child in a positive light. While there is still a high possibility of the experience being negative, there\\'s nothing making it necessarily impossible for it to be \"a very positive experience\". \\n\\nAdditionally, I do not believe that such a statement normalizes sexual acts with minors, or encourages people to engage in them. It simply declares that the act may be positive—not that it\\'s likely to be positive, or that one should perform it. The sheer amount of hate a pedophile encounters over the years is not going to be invalidated by a single statement, and neither is the act going to become any more legal from it. On the other hand, the rapists who disregard morals and laws don\\'t need any more encouragement to molest; they likely hate themselves already and commit the acts regardless or don\\'t find them to be wrong in the first place.\\n\\nTo state it again, however, if Milo really was promoting adults to go out and have sex with minors right now, an outrage would be justified due to the aforementioned high risk of indirectly causing children trauma. Before sex with minors is to be encouraged, the general view of pedophilia in society and laws regarding underage sex need to be reformed. Until this occurs, a person with access to a large (or any) audience should be scrupulous about the way they discuss this topic to protect the children they love.\\n\\n']},\n",

He describes what happened soon after this discovery in an essay he wrote:\\n\\n&gt;In order to aid my body I began taking growth hormone shots six days a week, pushing my body to catch up with my age; something I was not ready for on any level.  I instantly started experiencing changes that I couldn’t explain, changes I did not want. I started growing taller, but I also started growing breasts and having feelings that scared me. I hated that I was losing my flat chest; I tried denying it and refused to wear a bra as long as possible. These physical changes caused me to hide my body under layers of clothing. Nothing I tried was completely effective; the rate that my body was growing made it physically painful and more difficult to hide. I was successful for the most part in hiding the true size of my chest until it came to formal events where exposure was nearly unpreventable. This feeling of shame was something that was incredibly difficult for me to understand. I was a female. I should be excited to be drawing attention, right? I continued to struggle with this in silence, as I had no basic understanding behind why this was happening. This struggle became intertwined with my journey to understand my sexuality. \\n\\nLater in the essay, he describes how he started \"binding\" after he accepted his genderqueer identity, essentially wrapping tight fabric around his breasts to make his chest appear flatter and more masculine. Honestly, this image of tightly binding your breasts because you wish they weren\\'t there makes me feel uncomfortable and when I first read the essay, I was thinking, \"Something is not right in his head. Something is \\'unnatural.\\'\" But when I read it a second time, I thought, \"What those doctor\\'s did--forcing him to rapidly undergo a process of puberty that is supposed to take several years--was unnatural and messed up.\" Both the doctors and my friend were put in a tough situation and did what they thought was best. So why is our general tendency to make excuses for the doctors and to assume that a trans* person is messed up in the head?\\n\\n']},\n",

The main character of Breaking Bad is Walter White.  The main character of the Wire is the City of Baltimore.  \\n\\nWalter White is a brilliant chemist who\\'s life is plagued by settling, compromise, defeatism, and an all-consuming bitterness at the course his life took despite such early promise.  I\\'d argue the show didn\\'t really come into its own beyond its high concept until it really understood that Walt\\'s motivated by this bitterness, which wasn\\'t on display until the episode where his old Nobel partner offers him the sinecure with great health insurance.  After that episode, the show could no longer be about Walt making money for his family; it had to be about Walt getting his revenge on the world for never acknowledging his brilliance.\\n\\nBaltimore, as a character in the Wire, is a city well past its prime, whatever that might have been, and its residents, despite their increasing balkanization/alienation, are all unified in their pursuit of Theirs before the entire house caves in.  The criminals, trying to salvage some sort of life for themselves in increasingly monstrous ways, and the cops, motivated by the personal satisfaction of being smarter than their quarry rather than saving the city (with the notable exceptions of idealists Bunk and Greggs; the Season 5 dichotomy of Bunk/Greggs vs. McNulty/Freemon is totally intentional here), are mirrors of each other.  They\\'re cogs in a system that\\'s falling apart, and the point of the show is that the city itself, the main character, can\\'t stop its slide into decay because nobody has any clue how to reverse it (as shown by the \"role model/leader\" characters, Carcetti, Omar, Daniels, Cutty, and most importantly Michael), and even if they did, everyone is so morally compromised at this point that the trust necessary for such a reversal is impossible (Bubbles being the personification of the city itself).\\n\\nThey\\'re both shows that try to examine moral collapse in a non-judgmental way.  *They may still defy comparison*, but that\\'s because their subjects are radically different (one man\\'s agency vs. the systemic decline of a society), not their themes.

       "  'comments': ['I\\'m 21. I grew up in a family of Trekies but never bothered to watch the show myself, the extent of my knowledge being the two Abrams movies. Then after Christmas my grandfather died, and I started watching TNG (because he was super into trek and the funeral got me thinking about it).\\n\\nGenerally, today there are 3 types of serious (non-comedy) TV shows; existential ones (*Breaking Bad*), action ones (*Daredevil*), or the hybrids (*The Walking Dead*). The differences between the types is mostly where the violence hangs out; in shows like Daredevil there is anti-heroes and evil and the anti-hero resists evil. In shows like Breaking Bad, there evil and it dominates evil. And in shows like Walking Dead, there is evil and slightly-less evil, and evil fights evil. \\n\\nWhat sucks about modern tv is that these three categories are basically the same. Everything is cynical. Everyone is a villian. No confrontation is ever \"won\" without a massive causalities on the protag side. Nobody is good, even the most optimistic shows have \"heroes\" that are at best good-hearted renegades. At the other end of spectrum there are no heroes, just protagonists who are slightly less deranged than their opponents. And above all else, *every* problem is solved with violence. Drug lord in your territory? Shoot em. Rival survivor group? Shoot em. Kingpin making moves? Shoot em. Almost every show on TV today, 90% of plot arks are resolved by shooting their way out, either literally (Walking Dead Terminus ark) or figuratively (ex. Dexter murdering a killer). Diplomatic solutions almost *never* happen and when they do, they are very fragile and typical get shattered within a few episodes. \\n\\nThis is the TV background I come from, although it stretches way past TV (movies, video games, etc). So when I sat down to watch TNG, I was blown away by the sheer *optimism* of it. In TNG, most of their problems don\\'t even fit into a confrontation framework; they have problems about trade disputes, meeting new cultures, encountering new aliens, interpersonal relationships, etc etc. Sure each episode has a conflict, but very few episodes can be described as a situation where the enterprise is facing a direct existential threat that it must subdue by force. And even when those situations do occur, they are almost never resolved with an all-out gun fight; they are almost always defeated with diplomacy, or subterfuge, or bold executive decisions. \\n\\nThe sad reality is that, from an outsider\\'s perspective, this type of TV just doesn\\'t exist anymore, and even when it does (BoJack Horseman for example) its still very cynical; the good guys don\\'t win.\\n\\nAn interesting theory I heard once was that in a caveman society, there would only be two stories; hunter stories and gatherer stories. Hunter stories are very linear, and very black and white; \"me and Ug went into woods. Saw big mammoth beast. Fought mammoth beast. We won, we are hero\". These stories are popular because they are simple and easy to grasp; we have our side, there is there side, we are fighting them, if we kill them we win, and we are heroes. \\n\\nThe other type of story is the gatherer story. These tend to be less dramatic and less linear, but they also speak more about the human condition; \"today me and Ug picked berries by the stream, and she told a joke, and we watched the stars, and....\" etc etc. Less dramatic, sure, but it also captures the actual lived problem of being human  way more accurately then \"I went here and killed this\".\\n\\nOur society is obsessed with the first type of story, because it is easy. But I think the amazingness of Star Trek is that they were trying to tell the second type of story, and they did so with a focus on the limitlessness and ultimately hopefulness of our existance, which is something very very rare for mainstream TV to do. Is it a campy show? 100%. But it\\'s also one of the few shows I know that was unabashedly optimistic without devolving into stupidity, 1-dimensional morality and brute force (*cough* avengers *cough*)',\n",

If he let you and a dozen others internet users do so, he may have a problem when someone starts publishing and making money off of his characters.   \\n\\n2. Protection from lawsuit. If everyone has free reign to write any fan-fiction, there will be bound to be cases where someone wrote a story that was somewhat similar to a plot idea of one of the books the author is working on.

There is real harm caused by this use, which can be ameliorated by either using \\'they\\' as a singular gender-neutral pronoun, or by using the gendered pronouns interchangeably (obviously only in the cases where a \\'default\\' pronoun would be used).*\\n\\nAs a woman, every time I\\'m listening to a speech or watching a movie and someones refers to humanity as \\'man\\' or humankind as \\'mankind\\', it hurts. It hurts because it makes me feel invisible, that I don\\'t matter, that people like me aren\\'t and haven\\'t been important. To clarify - if this speech/movie/miscellaneous-word-delivery-method was made any time before 1975 or so, I just roll with it because that really was the default at the time.\\n\\nHowever, when \\'mankind\\'/\\'man\\' is used in a movie that I\\'m seeing in theatres, or by a federal politician during an election campaign trying to win my vote, it\\'s for one of two reasons:\\n\\n1) it didn\\'t even occur to the scriptwriter, speech-writer, etc. that there exists a widely-accepted alternative term which unlike the initial choice is inclusive of women, a historically disenfranchised and currently marginalized group, or\\n\\n2) the above did occur to them but they didn\\'t care.\\n\\nBoth of those options hurt my heart to think about, and they are personally harmful as well as to many others no doubt. They also, along with default male pronoun usage, reinforce the idea that the default *person* is male and thereby Other women. So, not only does this usage constitute a microaggression ([definition](http://www.microaggressions.com/about/)) against women and arguably non-binary folks, it encourages men to continue believing that women aren\\'t real people.**\\n\\nAlso, though the relative harm of default male pronoun usage may be small when compared to other actions, the recourse takes relatively very little effort as well. So given the benefits of using more inclusive language, the costs of doing otherwise, and low low price of \\'paus[ing] for a second to think about it\\', I think it\\'s a worthwhile endeavour.\\n\\nA final point: if we didn\\'t live in a sexist society, this would all matter much less.

My reasoning is exposure. Presumably, this paper is a widespread newspaper in terms of who can access it and with little, to no, restriction which concerns me in terms of exposure in young people. I am aware that most people, by the time they are 12 have seen at least one pair of breasts, but I don\\'t think that such a widely available media outlet should be allowed to make the content so accessible. I believe that by the time your 16, you\\'re old enough to make your own decisions related to this field and that letting someone 16 and older have sexual exploratory freedom (not freedom to have sex, but access to pornographic materials and aids) can decrease the feeling of taboo, and enable the teenager to make much better decisions based on thought, not lust (flawed I understand, but anything will be in this field). That having been said 15-  shouldn\\'t be able to access the material so easily; with the internet it\\'s already a bit too accessible as is. If we start, as a species, publishing nudity in media outlets as widespread as a top-selling newspaper, then we might as well abolish all of our laws relating to sexuality and reestablish a new set of laws regarding them. This simple act isn\\'t necessarily the Armageddon of society or anything, but it sends a message to everyone: We don\\'t care about trying to restrain sexuality anymore, so go do whatever you want as long as it doesn\\'t hurt anyone. \\n\\nIt also sets young women up to understand that nudity, and by extension sexuality is a frivolous and simple thing. Now, again, this is the land of grey areas for me, because I really do believe that it is, but under the age of 16 I don\\'t think that it should even cross your mind as anything more than discovering your own body and learning what sexuality is at all in private. I don\\'t believe that sex should be seen as okay until you\\'re at least 18. In my opinion, putting nudity in the newspaper undermines the efforts to restrain sexuality in place by schools, parents and governments, and to that end, I don\\'t think that it should be there. \\n\\nI apologize if that\\'s hard to read, it\\'s late for me at the moment, and I am tired, and this is a hard topic for me to debate because I both agree completely with you, and I have serious reservations about it.

This speed means that a lot of plants and animals that would normally be able to adapt to a changing climate over a period tens of thousands years or more now face similar periods of change measured in only a few hundred years. A lot of organisms are being threatened with extinction simply because of how fast things are heating up. If you recall from your basic high school biology classes that disrupting ecosystems can have problems where the entire ecosystem is affected when some of the organisms that are lowest on the food chain are reduced or removed. \\n\\n2. Consider the amount the wars and conflicts caused due to concerns over the oil supply. The Pacific theatre in WWII, Afganistan, Iraq (Gulf War I and II), the tensions with Iran ever since the CIA meddled with their government in the 1950s by installing a pro-US leader - the list goes on. Imagine instead of oil, it's *water*. As the Earth continues to warm, fresh water supplies will continue to become more valuable. It's very likely that conflicts will arise over who has access to clean water.\\n\\n3. Further acceleration. What's bad is that the climate of the Earth is delicate and not completely stable. By stable, I mean that if you disturb it, it predictably returns to some steady state. Instead, a small disturbance can quickly become a very large disturbance. Peat bogs that normally keep methane trapped will release methane as they are warmed, accelerating the heating, for example. Forests that are drier due to being hotter can burn more often than they otherwise would, releasing even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]},\n",

The email investigation had been ongoing for a while and I think most people had already made up their minds regarding this topic by the time of the second press conference.\\n\\nI don't think you're giving enough weight to this factor. Here's a summary why:\\n\\n&gt; Hillary Clinton would probably be president if FBI Director James Comey had not sent a letter to Congress on Oct. 28. The letter, which said the FBI had “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation” into the private email server that Clinton used as secretary of state, upended the news cycle and soon halved Clinton’s lead in the polls, imperiling her position in the Electoral College.\\n\\n&gt; The letter isn’t the only reason that Clinton lost. It does not excuse every decision the Clinton campaign made. Other factors may have played a larger role in her defeat, and it’s up to Democrats to examine those as they choose their strategy for 2018 and 2020.\\n\\n&gt; But the effect of those factors — say, Clinton’s decision to give paid speeches to investment banks, or her messaging on pocket-book issues, or the role that her gender played in the campaign — is hard to measure. ***The impact of Comey’s letter is comparatively easy to quantify, by contrast. At a maximum, it might have shifted the race by 3 or 4 percentage points toward Donald Trump, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida to him, perhaps along with North Carolina and Arizona. At a minimum, its impact might have been only a percentage point or so. Still, because Clinton lost Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by less than 1 point, the letter was probably enough to change the outcome of the Electoral College.***\\n\\n[The Comey Letter Probably Cost Clinton The Election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/) \\n\\nThat being said, it wasn't the ONLY reason, but I think it's fair to say that all other things being equal, the Comey letter alone had an effect measured to be greater than the vote differential in those critical rust belt states. Should she have campaigned more in those states? Yes, absolutely -- shoulda, woulda, coulda. However, without the Comey letter, she likely would have still won those states even with her shitty campaigning there. \",\n",
       "   \"&gt;However, without the Comey letter, she likely would have still won those states even with her shitty campaigning there. \\n\\nSee...this is what I am questioning and have yet to be convinced of.\\n\\nPolls were tightening even before Comey's letter was leaked, and I think it largely had to do with swing voters making up their minds based on the messaging of the campaigns, not any external factors. \\n\\nRegardless, I have to see any serious evidence that this was the determining factor for the tens of thousands of voters that swung this election.  still remember the utter and complete shock of virtually everyone in the country as the results came in. Very few people gave Trump even a slight chance of winning, so I think trying to place blame on these external factors is a rationalization.\",\n",
       "   'Another reply-- I think to get to the heart of this we need to distill down principles of causation. My conclusion is grounded in the \\'cause in fact\\' standard and I\\'m not entirely clear on your standard of causation. \\n\\nCause in fact is sometimes called the *“but-for”* cause or the *“without-which-not”* cause. I.e. if we could go back in time and eliminate the Comey letter from the sequence of campaign related events, would Clinton still have lost? (*But for* Comey\\'s emails, would she have lost?) If the answer is no, then Comey\\'s letter can be considered the *“cause in fact”* of her losing the election. \\n\\nHere, we have several unrelated events and are looking to determine which of them is responsible for a single outcome, which complicates the *but for* analysis. \\n\\nWhere two or more causes that would not have caused the outcome alone, but that do cause the outcome when combined, we have *concurrent causation.* As an example, suppose that a construction worker takes the cover off a manhole, but does not put a barrier up to prevent pedestrians from falling in. A pedestrian is walking near the open manhole when she is hit by a car, which knocks her into the hole. The pedestrian is injured. If the manhole had been open but the driver had not hit the pedestrian, the pedestrian would not have fallen in the hole. But if the manhole had been closed and the driver had hit the pedestrian, the pedestrian would not have fallen in the manhole either. Here, two concurrent causes combined to result in the pedestrian falling into the manhole and both causes are responsible. Correct me if I\\'m wrong-- It sounds like you\\'re suggesting that if only she had campaigned \"harder\" in those blue wall states, she would NOT have lost the election *regardless of the effect of Comey\\'s October surprise letter?* I think that\\'s really hard to say definitively either way. \\n\\nAlternatively,  there is *sufficient combined cause* -- two causes combine to result in an outcome, but either cause would have resulted in that outcome even without the other. The classic example is of two forest fires, each set by a separate person, that combine and then burn down the your barn. Either fire could have burned down the barn by itself. Here, both the fires are a cause in fact, even though the outcome would have been the same if only one fire had been set. As applied to the election, we\\'d say that either the shitty campaigning or the Comey letter could have caused her election loss by itself. \\n\\nI\\'d disagree with this last conclusion because she was on track to win before the Comey letter, even if only by a squeaker. After the letter her polls showed a decided and definitive downturn with the Comey letter being the deciding factor and without which she would have won. That is why I argue that, *but for Comey\\'s letter,* she would not have lost in those states. Yes, she might not have lost if she had run a better campaign generally, but Comey\\'s letter was the last intervening factor in closest proximity to the outcome. \\n\\n**Edit: I don\\'t disagree that she \"shoulda woulda coulda\" run a better campaign, or that she bears no responsibility for that. What I\\'m saying is that the evidence is persuasive that the Comey letter was the deciding factor in her loss.** \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

All of which started as US Navy task forces, which were then supplemented with allied ships. Apparently, there isn\\'t a lot of info about active deployments for ships, but I think over half of the ships fielded are by the US.

Saddam Hussein is murdering all his freaking people, and people call us callous for doing nothing when we could prevent it. We take the place by storm, and people call us warmongering oil hounds. It\\'s like we\\'re protecting millions of armchair generals who only exist to criticize every move we make in their defense. We are the first nation in history that rose to the top and dedicated themselves to preservation instead of conquering, and people say we aren\\'t doing enough.\\n\\nIt cracks me up when Redditors talk about the oh-so-enlightened Nordic paradises and look down their noses at the brutish, backwards States. They never seem to realize that the Nordic countries are bordering one of the most aggressive, powerful nations on the planet, one that could squash them all in pretty short order without NATO\\'s protection.

       "  'comments': ['There are two separate issues here. One is that your focus on trying to changes other people\\'s views may be unfruitful because you are unpersuasive and you are alienating other people rather than changing minds. Another is that people don\\'t change their mind because they, as you put it, \"believe whatever they want to believe\".\\n\\nI won\\'t challenge the first point. It\\'s quite possible that you are exercising poor judgment in deciding when, where, and how to change people\\'s opinions. As a reductio ad absurdum, it\\'s clear that someone at a critical juncture in, say, finishing a surgery or landing and aircraft shouldn\\'t abandon the task at hand to make a moral argument. We all have critical events of various types going on in our lives - we can screw those up by drinking too much, philosophizing too much, exercising too much... my point is that I\\'m agreeing with this part of your claim while denying it as anything to do with moral views, sexual equality, etc.\\n\\nBut as for the second, here I disagree deeply. You seem to think that because people are unaffected by your arguments they must be sheeple. But consider these possibilities:\\n\\n1. Your arguments probably aren\\'t nearly so *conclusive* as you are making them out to be. You may have a good point but an invalid argument, or an valid argument resting on unsound premises. Any serious argument is very complex and your friends aren\\'t wrong to think their own analytical incompetence doesn\\'t prove your point.\\n\\n2. We all tend to assume other people are most convinced by what convinces us. But some people go in for data, some go in for logic, others go for analogies, or thought experiments, or ridicule, or witty aphorisms. If people don\\'t want to be around you, you probably aren\\'t paying attention to what sorts of persuasion they enjoy.\\n\\n3. When you talk specifically about popular morality, remember that if it is *popular* that means a lot of people believe it. Popular morality may be obviously wrong or completely wrong but it can\\'t be *obviously completely wrong* or else, actually, no one would believe it, because someone else would have come up with your clever arguments long before you did. The persistence of popular morality implies either that your arguments are obscure and difficult, in which case you need to clarify them, or they are easy and unoriginal, in which case there are probably a dozen refutations floating around.\\n\\n4. On a further note - I assume from what you write about people in the next room you are living in some sort of roommate situation, and are therefore young. If you are young: when did you reach the beliefs you currently argue for? Last year? Three years ago? If you are constantly learning new things that change your mind about this or that, consider that maybe you should be more measured: in a year you may learn new information that will re-reverse this view.\\n\\n5. You speak as though the pleasure of talking and the rigor of arguing were two very different things. But a good argument should be stimulating, relevant, and provocative. If you are instead boring, trivial, and soporific, your argument may be technically correct, but still worthless.\\n\\n7. As an additional point, don\\'t be so sure people aren\\'t ignoring you because they hate arguments. They may love arguments but have no interest in engaging with you, for one reason or another. You may even be out of your league.\\n\\n8. Finally... don\\'t think for a second that people are only listening to you if they change their minds on the spot. Normally it\\'s much more gradual.']},\n",

Most of the popular apps I was interested in, like Snapchat or Shazam, were built for the iphone and then ported to Android after the fact. The result was that the app didn\\'t function very well, didn\\'t accommodate different camera/speaker specs, and didn\\'t run the way it was \\'supposed to\\'.\\n\\nSwitching to iphone was amazing for this reason alone. I could finally use these apps (and others) in the way I wanted to use them, vs. the watered down version. \\n\\nThat\\'s reason 1. That I preferred iphone to Android. Another problem with Android was the degree to which it could be customized. When I initially got my \\'droid, I was pumped to customize it, really make it something that stood out. To this end I played with the apps, downloaded extra content, fucked around with the app layout/shortcuts/whatever, and for a while, it was good. The problem was that I didn\\'t track my steps, and after about 8 months of completely re-writing my phone every few weeks, it became almost unusable. Dead links, broken apps, files missing, you name it, I had it. I had fucked around with it so much that it became this huge mess, a Frankenstein of customization gone wrong. \\n\\nWhen I switched to iphone, this problem was solved. I knew exactly what I was getting, I knew exactly how the layout worked, I knew exactly what I could and couldn\\'t do with it. It was *simple*, I didn\\'t need or want to change anything.\\n\\nNow, the tech-savvy people here are probably scoffing, but I\\'m not tech-savvy. I know nothing of phone customization, of the potential an android has in terms of specs, or of what I would have to do to \"clean up\" my Frankenstein phone. As an end user, I don\\'t want to spend three hours constructing the perfect phone, and then maintaining it. I want something that works, no matter what I throw at it. The iphone solution to this problem may be Orwellian, but it also saved me the trouble of having to go to the Android website and spend 5 hours trouble shooting my broken phone back into something usable. \\n\\nFinal reason, one that has nothing to do with technology: iphones are expensive, and all my friends have one.\\n\\niphones are not cheap; I bought a 4 when the 5 came out, and it still net me like 300$. The 5 was like 900$ at the time. Spending a lot of money on a phone, from a psychological angle, leads to sunk costs. \\n\\nFurther, all my friends have an iphone. For a long time, I was the only android user. With an iphone, I now feel like I\\'m part of the in-crowd, which is something that no amount of tech superiority on Android\\'s part can beat. \\n\\nAnd that isn\\'t the only problem Android has, brand wise. iphone still carries an insane amount of brand weight. iphone\\'s are easily recognizable, and are the \\'default\\' phone represented in media; there\\'s one of the cover of GTA for example. iphone\\'s are standardized; while androids come in many shapes and sizes, everybody can tell an iphone at first glance. Unlike the default iphone, Android occupies second place, and is viewed as second best, or even worse, \"i got it because I couldn\\'t afford an iphone\". iphone is hip; my mom, dad, and grandma all have Android, me and my brother have iphones. Apple is still associated with the future of technology, while Android is at best chasing the throne.\\n\\nThis is just a brief list of the branding problems Android has in comparison to iphone. While they don\\'t reflect on the quality of the phone itself, it does play a big role in the consumer\\'s decision to purchase a phone.

Or a country with an extremely high level of poverty? In those places, corruption is almost as natural as waving and saying hi to people along the street. Countries like India, China, Nigeria, Egypt, Greece, Spain, Italy, etc. These places have huge corruption problems. But it's also really difficult to gauge the extent of the corruption in these countries. In the US, it's much easier.\\n\\n**Do you know why corruption happens?**\\n\\nWhen a person's work has greater value than he/she is paid to do it, that person can leverage the value of their work, or the power they have access to, in order to increase their salary. If their salary is so high that leveraging that power and potentially losing the job isn't worth it, then corruption won't be a problem.\\n\\nAround the world people complain about the decadent lives of politicians and rulers, the excessive salaries, etc. **But top pay is how top talent is retained**. Without high pay, government officials can be easily corrupted because their jobs are hard and they have access to a lot of power and should be compensated for that.\\n\\nIndia has huge problems with police corruption. Nearly every person can tell you that cops extort citizens, will take bribes to look the other way on crimes, etc. This happens not because the cops are greedy, but rather [because cop salaries are so poor they literally can't afford to live on them](http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/constable-s-income-not-enough-to-sustain-family-in-this-city/story-crcUXULWIApiDJFbD86J7M.html).\\n\\nGovernment officials have higher salaries in the US, but the principle here still stands.

In virtually all cases, high levels of deprivation, neglect, and abuse occurred in the life history of the offenders. And guess what? Poverty is the single best predictor of child abuse and neglect. In a United States study, children who lived in families with an annual income less than $15,000 are 22 times more likely to be abused or neglected than children living in families with an annual income of $30,000 or more.

It will, however, make it harder to find people who still want to talk about it after so much time has passed.\\n\\nThe purpose of a discussion about any topic is to hear different views and outlooks (generally), but these different views and outlooks don\\'t fade with more information which may or may not emerge one week later. If someone wants to talk about breaking news, while waiting for more information is never a bad idea on its own, refusing to discuss something because more information might come out later as a general rule is a bad idea. People still vehemently argue over events that happened thousands of years ago, and time and information doesn\\'t necessarily make anyone\\'s opinions more or less extreme. If you don\\'t want to \"waste your valuable time\" talking about certain subjects, that is fine. But waiting a set period of time doesn\\'t really help anything and just makes it harder to find people who want to talk. ']},\n",

       "  'comments': ['I don\\'t think you really understand what BDD is. I lived with a girl who had very severe BDD for a number of years, and I learnt a lot about the condition.\\n\\nBDD has absolutely nothing to do with how you look. Anyone could have it.\\n\\nBDD is also not about how you think you look. That is a far over-simplified explanation of the disorder.\\n\\nBDD is a total *obsession* with certain (usually quite specific) aspects of one\\'s appearance. An obsession so severe it prevents a person from functioning normally. BDD is closely tied in with OCD and many people with BDD may also have OCD.\\n\\nFor example, the girl I lived with had a number of obsessions - one was her skin. She would perceive imperfections in her skin and pick at it for hours. The fact that she didn\\'t have these imperfections (or that they were nowhere near as bad as she made out) has no relevance - it is the sheer preoccupation with the condition - the getting \"stuck in the mirror\", literally not being able to think about anything else that is the problem.\\n\\nObviously, not all ugly/fat people have BDD because BDD is not just simply thinking that you\\'re ugly/fat. It is completely possible to function normally thinking that you\\'re ugly/fat.\\n\\nIt\\'s when these obtrusive thoughts severely affect your day to day functioning that it becomes a disorder - and this can happen whether or not you\\'re *actually* ugly or fat.\\n\\nI would suggest reading The Broken Mirror by Katharine Phillips for more insight into the condition.',\n",
       "   \"I agreed with OP at first, but you make an excellent point.\\n\\nStill, the *issue* remains that people who are obsessed with their bad looks, who look objectively bad, should be treated differently from people who actually look normal. \\n\\nI've discussed BDD with a previous therapist of mine, and while she did not diagnose me with it, the notion of someone having BDD itself seems to carry within it an inherent dismissive attitude to any appearance-related challenges a person might actually be facing. In this light, perhaps there should be a separate diagnosis for... uh... ugly people's obession with their ugliness.\",\n",

Think about why cigarette companies aren\\'t allowed to advertise the way they used to. They advertise (usually to youth) and they just have to get that person to smoke a single cigarette or (at most a single) pack and they\\'re hooked. They don\\'t have to convince that person to smoke anymore, the cigarette will do it for them. Similar for alcohol, similar for gambling. Are they willingly engaging? Depends on who you ask, but some people have tried to quit these activities for decades, so it\\'s not exactly on account of their own freedom.\\n\\nI\\'m rather libertarian in view and don\\'t believe prohibition works, but that\\'s why these things are often limited in their accessibility or tacked with sin taxes. I also believe in providing services to people afflicted with addiction so they can stop if willing, but this needs funding and means raising taxes.\\n\\nA rather obvious side effect, but since people that are addicted are often not in control, they also aren\\'t necessarily able to moderate themselves. Families are affected by addiction when people gamble away their life savings. \\n\\n_______________________\\n\\n&gt; No stratified income tax shall be such that those in higher tax brackets feel unduly punished for their marginal additional income (IE, if income up to $200k is taxed at 25% and income over $200k is taxed at 50%, the value of dollars earned over $200k goes down too much, too fast. This principle is of course subjective, as it is not protecting a fundamental right, but followers of this ideology would keep it in mind when creating tax law or debating tax policy\\n\\nWhy would they feel punished? I don\\'t see how this connects to your ideology at all.\\n\\n&gt; (Most critically and most interesting) Taxes are a tool to be used to offset negative externalities, but are NOT a tool to use for social engineering.\\n\\n&gt; Example: The government wants fewer people to gamble, so they impose a 5% tax on all gambling winnings. This tax would NOT be permitted. A tax cannot be used to induce action or deter action alone.\\n\\nWhy not? There are activities that produce no value to society and even negatively affect individuals and society (if only slightly) when compared to their opportunity costs. Wouldn\\'t it be logical to disincentivize negative activities and promote their more productive or less harmful alternatives?\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nAlso, how does your system handle things like bribery?

But when we\\'re talking about restricting personal freedoms and rights, only other\\'s *rights* are considered when determining if an action is harming nonparticipant third parties. It\\'s a right not to have someone steal your money, or to not be murdered or raped, or to not be woken up in the night by loud noises. It\\'s not a right to not have your best friend make you feel sad. Thanks for helping me clear that up though :)\\n\\n&gt;When something is addictive, willingly engage isn\\'t nearly as black and white.\\n\\nI\\'ll define \"Willingly engaging\" as \"physically making the choice to engage in an activity,\" sorry if that wasn\\'t clear. Trying to get into the \"we\\'re not fully in control of our own actions and therefore we need the government to tell us what we can do for our own good\" reasoning is a great way to end up with your rights restricted. Better for a thounsand men to fall prey to gambling of their own fault (nonpartipant third parties harmed: 0; people\\'s rights restricted: 0), than for a single responsible man to be prevented from engaging in something that would be harmless (people\\'s rights restricted: 1). \\n\\nAgain, you mention families, but a wife doesn\\'t really have the \"right\" to control her husband\\'s spending - she gave up this right at marriage.

If they negatively affect society in a material way, I made a provision that would allow a tax to compensate for that.

Or to put it another way that we should always search for evidence to justify our assumptions and not accept them truly on faith in a global sense.\\n\\nMy response is that the legitimacy of faith as an explanation, or the requirement for empirical evidence, is going to be based on the question being asked. Different questions are best answered using different epistemological methodologies. For instance, if I want to know how tall I am, the best way to gather that information would be to use inductive reasoning and measure myself. If I want to know whether it is consistent to support both abortion and the death penalty I will use deductive reasoning to see if the assumptions involved in my support for those views conflicts. Deductive reasoning would be fairly useless in answering the first question, and vice versa for the second.\\n\\nThe question then is is there any class of problems best solved by faith based responses. I believe there probably is such a set of questions. I am going to substitute the word intuition here which I feel is a fair stand in for a faith based belief since an intuition is a belief not based on any form of reasoning.\\n\\nSo what types of questions then are best answered with intuition. In general they are questions that relate to your own conscious experience. For instance, if I want to know whether I am happy or not I can\\'t use deductive or inductive reasoning. I merely consult my own consciousness and accept that intuition of whether I am happy. If I want to know whether I am sad, even though there might be behavioral correlates I cannot collect evidence for whether I feel sad in my own mind. The only way to answer such a question definitively is to accept the intuition at face value and go from there based on faith. There do appear to be some questions best answered by faith and intuition.\\n\\nSo lets try to bring this back to religion which seems to be at least part of the central focus of your question. From the perspective of a religious person you might say that the question of whether there is a God or not is best answered using the same methodology as whether or not you are happy. The way you perceive God is as a part of your own consciousness and therefore in the same way that you wouldn\\'t approach a question of your own conscious state with inductive or deductive reasoning you can\\'t this one. It is a question best answered by intuition or put another way best answered by faith.\\n\\nOf course this is somewhat of an arbitrary designation, but there is no particularly good reason we would expect the question of whether there is a God to be one best answered with an inductive methodology either. At the end of the day it is a question we know sufficiently little about how to answer that we cannot be sure which methodology is best suited. It could full well end up being a question best approached from a faith/intuition based methodology. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "   \"Excellent response. Really.\\n\\nAnd even though I'm not totally swayed yet, I do have to commend you on giving me another lens to look at belief in God through. For that I think you deserve this. \\n\\n∆\\n\\nHowever I do have a few more questions:\\n\\nWouldn't that depend on your definition of God though? You said when you want to know whether you're sad or happy, you consult your feelings and take it on faith that your feelings correspond to your current emotional state (personally I think this is a little bit of a copout, I don't believe that you need any faith at all to trust that the fact that you feel happy means that you are actually truly happy, but I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here) and in the same way, from the perspective of a religious person, the idea of whether or not a God exists is deduced in the same way - if you're feelings tell you that there is something else out there, you can take it on faith that it is true.\\n\\nBut how about the common version of God accepted by most theists around the world: an infinite, omnipotent, omnipresent, individually interested creator of the universe capable of exacting His will anywhere at any instant?\\n\\nIsn't a claim that a being of this sort exits deserving of the use of inductive or deductive reasoning to prove it's validity? Why wouldn't it be?\",\n",

Do you suggest children should face the financial burden of repaying 10 or 18 years of benefits once they get into the workforce?  Or should that burden fall onto their parents? And who's going to help their parents when they have to repay that debt? Their children.  This is basically a poor tax.\\n\\nThe other thing is that benefits like Medicaid, foodstamps, subsidized housing, etc. Can account for the wage equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars of benefits per year. If people are forced to pay it back, they are even more likely to never go off it entirely. \\n\\nFinally, you view wellfare as a personal loan when you should view it as a kind of insurance.  Anybody can fall on hard times and suddenly find themselves in dire straights.  Social safety nets are there to protect those that fall off.  You don't demand that they pay that money, since they were paying a portion as taxpayers, the same way you don't demand a patient pay back their medical bill that insurance covered, as they were paying their premiums. \",\n",
       "   \"To clarify when you say the majority of recipients are children, is this including families with children or solely no-parent cases of welfare recipients. These are completely different scenarios as a family with head(s) of household receieving benefit would, just like tax deductions on dependents, not be expected to repay the cost of welfare needed to raise a child. If it is a non-parent household then the government is subsidizing the entire assistance unit they are in with to begin with, in which minors would not be held accountable for repayment as well. This leaves still a large amount of the remaining cases to which I was referring to.\\n\\nThe expected repayment multiplier is set so that your second point would never be the case. If you can only pay back 60%, you're only expected to pay back 60%. \\n\\nThe way in which you view welfare in relation to health insurance is somewhat analogous, except for the fact that you could play the cost-benefit analysis game to determine how much you are paying into welfare vs. how much you should be paying based on estimated likelihoods of need. Rough estimates I'm considering would indicate that insurance would be a little more financially responsible, however I could consider this point in more depth.\",\n",

It\\'s very difficult to qualify for social assistance if you don\\'t have children, and it usually provides for all the family/parents, as the thinking goes that it\\'s better for the kids if their parent is healthy and nourished.

I'm going to be so bold as to quote from one of my previous comments, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g5mqj/everyone_is_secretly_depressed_cmv/cah08sv):\\n\\n&gt;Well, this model of life actually works for me personally. I think that the whole there-is-no-point-or-meaning-to-anything is the sobering truth, after a certain fashion. But humans are built to survive (evolution, bitches!). In a healthy human, there is some sort of psychological block that prevents you from worrying about the lack of absolute truth, that allows you to be content with the superficial purpose and meaning that we endow our life with, and the things that surround us. A healthy human can be aware of the gaping chasm of the absurd, and yet still able to function.\\n\\n&gt;There are many intermediate steps between the oblivious unquestioning (naive?) worker bee and the tortured soul on the brink of self-destruction, and different people require different coping mechanisms to deal with the different amounts of existential anxiety that plague them - escapism can be such a coping mechanism, for example. But, for some people, the coping mechanisms work.\\n\\nThe point in the above is that the psychological block present in healthy people is disabled in certain types of depression, rendering them unable to function. \\n\\nHowever, it seems to me to be somewhat silly to claim that depressed people are, as a general rule, more lucid about everything. \\n\\nDepressed people are typically very insecure about *something*. It could be the fact that other people don't want to be with them, don't like them, that nobody cares about them. The dark thoughts and doubts that plague them colour their opinions, and are certainly in no way *lucid* - they almost always represent serious misjudgments of the reality of social interaction. There is a reason that we treat depression as a mental condition. \\n\\nThe above seems sort of obvious and inconsequential, but I would like to highlight one very important thing that follows from it: **if you are depressed, you can't allow yourself to think that this makes you smart, lucid, or right about things (whatever they are)**. You are still subject to mental prejudice and psychological imperatives - they are just different from the ones that healthy people are subject to. \\n\\n\"]},\n",

Hell, sometimes its so cold that I have to carry her in when I take her out, because by the time she's done doing her business, her feet hurt too much from the cold and she can't walk.\\n\\nFor a dog like her, surviving cold nights just wouldn't be a matter of natural habitats or domestication. She could be wild and free from the day she was born and she still wouldn't stand a chance. I'm giving her a warm, safe place to sleep. Free from predators, out of the elements, and with a never ending supply of food.\\n\\nBut even aside from all of that, I am a bit selfish in owning a dog and thinking that most people should have a pet. It doesn't matter how shitty my day was, I can count on the fact that I've got a friend in her. Some days the bullshit can really pile on, but that doesn't matter because at least something is excited by the fact that I exist. It's wonderful how quickly your troubles can melt away by hugging a dog who is genuinely excited to see you and has no expectations other than a scratch under the chin.\"]},\n",

A language is more than substituting words with a dictionary.  A person getting angry in Japanese sounds like every other person in Japanese, usually also getting angry.

There's nothing wrong with his acting, and it's iconic.  That I don't know the Japanese actor doesn't matter to me.  Having to hear it in Japanese would have turned me off.  This is cynical, but anime producers want people watching their stuff.  They translate because they want a larger audience.

If you put money into it, it will show.  *The Brotherhood of the Wolf* is a French film and I didn't even know that the first time I watched it.

       "  'comments': ['I think you\\'ve raised some very interesting points, and I\\'m in agreement with the principle behind what you\\'re saying, but I think there are some things that need to be clarified here.\\n\\nFirst of all, the key underlying assumption I think you\\'re making, is that your mind and your body are two separate entities. Suppose you\\'re 20 years old now, and you go back 2 years in the past. It will be your 20-year-old brain inside your 18-year-old body, and the world around you will be exactly the same as when you originally experienced it, but you\\'ll have the memories of those next 2 years. Am I correct in assuming that or no? If I\\'m wrong in saying that, then ignore the rest of my comment.\\n\\nIf that\\'s true, the analogy is essentially the same as an RPG video game, where you can re-load previous saves. Your brain is you, and your body is the video game character. So for instance, suppose you\\'re playing Fallout 3 right now, and you\\'re on a specific quest for the first time. You don\\'t know a priori which dialog options will give you the best outcome for that mission. So you can choose Option A and see what happens, then re-load and choose Option B and see what happens, and then re-load again and choose whichever outcome you prefer.\\n\\nThat would be pretty nice in theory, but there are some problems I have with this. It ultimately boils down to this. How do you reconcile the differences between the two times?\\n\\nThey are two completely different times/lifespans. If you go back 2 years in time, your brain is 2 years older than your body. Looking at the video game example, your Fallout character can have 100 or 150 hours of \"life\" (i.e. playing time), but you have 20 years of life (or whatever your current age is).\\n\\nWhat happens in the event of death? If your body dies, does your brain die with it? Or do you get the opportunity to rewind before your death, and start life again at a different time? I suspect your answer is the latter. That would be mine too.\\n\\nNow what happens if your brain dies? So let\\'s say you\\'re playing Fallout right now, and you have a massive heart attack and die. You\\'re not there to control your character any more, so your character (i.e. your body) will just be standing still for the remainder of eternity (technically until your PS3 does an auto-shut-down or your power gets disconnected). Your body will be in a state of limbo for eternity, at whichever age you\\'re living in for your brain\\'s last moment.\\n\\nSo if you go back to age 10 to re-live some childhood memory, and your brain dies, then your 10-year-old body will be standing still forever, at the playground or whatever. If that happens, you\\'ll obviously cause your friends/family to be very disturbed and saddened. But more importantly, they\\'ll never have a memory of you past age 10. So you may fall in love with your high-school sweetheart and live a happy life with her, but if you rewind back to age 10 and then your brain dies, your soulmate will have never met you. It will be a completely one-sided memory, and she\\'ll go on to marry some Chad instead. That sucks, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nNot only is this true for any relationships, it\\'s also true for any of your physical actions and legacies as well. So if you find a cure for cancer, rewind before it was cured and then your brain dies, nobody will ever actually benefit from your cancer cure. If you build your dream mansion, and die in a state of rewind before it was built, it no longer exists for anyone else.\\n\\nI believe that one of the main reasons people fear death, is that they are afraid of being forgotten and not leaving behind any memories or legacy. If that\\'s something that\\'s core to your identity (I\\'m assuming it is, because that\\'s a natural human feeling), then you\\'re really gambling with this, since your body\\'s death can happen at any time for reasons completely out of your control (car accident, hit by a bus, etc). You don\\'t even have to die for this problem to manifest itself - simply getting into some kind of accident that leaves you mentally incapacitated would have the same risk.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the reward/risk ratio would still be worth it, but only for very short rewinds. Rewinding years at a time could cause very big problems. I think you would be wise to put a cap on the amount of time you can travel during any one rewind. But if you do that, the power is obviously very limited, and wouldn\\'t be nearly as useful as you would describe. It would still be neat and nice to have, but not the best superpower ever.',\n",

I had a nice little chat with /u/Beelzebubs-Barrister already so I'll draw from there in saying that the power you describe is different than the power I describe.\\n\\nThe rewind power that I'm comparing with other powers completely resets your body (including your brain) but your memories/identity are carried over from before rewinding. Someone with an immaterial view of the mind might not even question this but someone with a material view of the mind (like me!) can understand this as your brain state on departure being imprinted on your brain at arrival. That is, your brain at the earlier time is reconfigured to match your brain at the (now erased) later time. Since the power does literally nothing unless your memories carry over, this is a required feature for being able to rewind time for everything except yourself. Since the power involves perceiving time rewinding - otherwise you can't decide when to arrive - this imprinting would happen continuously as your brain changes in reaction to whatever it sees as time rewinds.\\n\\nDoes that address your concerns? I can elaborate more on this mechanism, if you like, but it's possible that the similar discussion here with Beelzebubs will have enough of an elaboration.\",\n",

I've elaborated on a materialist mechanism for this in a nice little chat here that I link at the end of the OP :) Imo, Rewind with this feature is, if not the *only* rewind power, then certainly still a single power. Namely, sending your brain back in time to your old body *is* a power but so is sending only your memories (preserving personal identity depending on your view); the power I've described only sends your memories/perspective back in time (by rewinding everything else).

If you make an exception for rape, you are essentially saying that it is ok to murder a child as long as it's under a certain age. What specifically changes to the babies rights because it was conceived of rape?

It is essentially saying it is ok to murder a child because the child was conceived without the woman's consent. It seems logically inconsistent to say that you have the right to murder a child only when the child was conceived without your consent. The right of the child should take precedent in all instances.

If a mother is 7 month pregnant and doesn't want to carry anymore she can find someone to remove the child but not harm the child.

The only part she is allowed to harm is herself.\\n\\nThis is the only logically sound pro-choice argument I can come up with. \\n\\nA logical pro-life argument would have to involve some form of inability to rescind consent once consent was given.

Personally, I think the time it goes past potential is where it can survive on its own without the mother. At that point, it goes from potential, to actual life and this is where it gains rights IMO. Realistically, this is going to be different for everyone, so setting the final abortion date a little before this is the most realistic option.\\n\\n&gt;Not kill the baby, just remove it from the mother.\\n\\nThis is weird argument. Removing the baby at 5 weeks is essentially killing it. Removing it at 6 months has a large chance at killing it as well. This just sounds like abortion by a different name. Removing it at 7 months seems like a good way to purposefully give the child permanent (and in your case, preventable) disabilities. At this point, the child can live on it's own outside of the mother, but doing so can permanently disable it. Since most people would agree the baby has rights at this point, the mother's right to disable the child sounds like assault. I don't think her right trumps the babies at this point.\\n\\n&gt;So if a woman chooses to have sex then she consents her body to be used by a fetus.\\n\\nI understand this argument in theory, even if I don't agree with.

A zygote is just potential. It requires incubation. I see that as being no different than sperm and eggs being potential. They just require fertilization.

The only way they should take that away is if you are doing something that endangers the other people who want to use the road. \\n\\n&gt; ..the White House, so I can stay there when I want. ....paying all civil servants, and since they work for me, they should listen to what I tell them to do.\\n\\nThe purpose of paying taxes is not to use the white house for a residence. The purpose is so your elected leader can live/work there. \\n\\n&gt; There are negative externalities to people not wearing their seat belts. When someone is a car accident and is seriously injured, it require far more of a response from the state than if that person had been wearing that same seat belt.\\n\\nPeople should incur the costs of having a car accident. There is no reason to socialize it to begin with. \\n\\n&gt; I guess my main distinction was that its not \"your money\" its \"our money\".

       "  'comments': ['I don\\'t think it\\'s sick. First, let\\'s posit that something being \"sick\" occurs on a spectrum. Making fun of Justin Bieber on television? I would say it\\'s not *that* sick. Of course it\\'s not good, but the whole situation surrounding his celebrity and celebrity culture in general is not great.\\n\\nLet\\'s ask sincerely, has Justin Bieber made a large part of his life public and consented or even *welcomed* people to take part in his persona and life experience? From a quick glance at his Twitter and various interviews, it is clear to me that he has, probably above all else, tried to make himself a public figure.\\n\\nLet\\'s be real: people making fun of you is part of the job description of being a celebrity. Just as potentially being shot at and dealing with drunken people is part of a policeman\\'s job; being in the public eye is a part of a celebrity\\'s job. Would it be great if these unfortunate job-specific problems weren\\'t part of the job? Sure. But they are and they\\'re not reasonably going to go away soon.\\n\\nI would say that as far as occupational hazards go, being shot at deserves far more sympathy than being made fun of on TV. Justin Bieber is 19 years old. He can be reasonably expected to know that drunk driving and drag racing are NOT acceptable things to do. Maybe if he did those things at the beginning of his career when he was 13 or whatever, sure. But as a society we *do* draw lines for responsibility and we *need* to. \\n\\nThis reasonable delineation of responsibility, coupled with his *own* decision to continue to publicize his life for fame and money is compelling enough to me to not sympathize very much. Perhaps most compellingly: what would happen to your average kid in this case? \\n\\nThe probability of your average say, lower class African American male caught drunk driving and resisting arrest of being killed, suffering police brutality, or having their *entire* life ruined is much higher than the probability that this event will have any lasting negative effect on Justin Bieber. In fact, it will probably strengthen his career. Nothing *really* bad is going to happen to Justin Bieber as a result of this than cannot be reasonably attributed to his own actions. \\n\\nI would say it is way better to accrue fame (your ostensible and demonstrated goal anyway) than be killed as a result of police brutality or be extremely hard-to-employ for stupid teenage acts. My sympathy for the latter far outstrips the former.',\n",

First, note that I referred to it as \"kind of sick\" - this isn\\'t dog fighting or pedophilia here.

Your expectation of anonymity goes out the door when you are a celebrity.\\n\\nI also agree that he deserves no sympathy, and that I hope he is prosecuted to the same extent that a non-famous person would be, and I wouldn\\'t feel bad if he gets the same penalty (or if it\\'s a financial penalty, one in proportion to his ability to pay).\\n\\nFinally, I agree that being mocked is better than being killed.\\n\\nBut none of that changes the idea that making fun of people when they screw up isn\\'t nice, unless it\\'s related to their profession.  But you can tell that as soon as the word spread of his arrest, the writers for all of these shows jumped for joy.  It\\'s that delight in others\\' failings that I think it sick.

(Assuming we are not celebrities)\\n\\nIf I had to answer honestly, I would say of course there is a difference:\\n\\n1. I never asked to be a public figure.\\n2. I don\\'t spend lots of time and effort trying to be in the public eye.\\n3. I don\\'t benefit from being a public figure.\\n4. I don\\'t have the resources to deal with/fight the attention: PR team, legal team, industry connections, media connections.\\n5. My career isn\\'t positively proportional to my public fame/notoriety like Justin Bieber\\'s. In fact, for most people, their careers would be *negatively* impacted by public fame.\\n\\nFor these reasons, it would be extremely rude for a television host to single me out and make fun of me for my acts. It would even be surreal and probably they would catch a lot of flak for it. That\\'s the difference, Justin Bieber asked to be a public figure, has the expectation, and resources to be a public figure (PR and legal team), and thrives rather than gets fired for being in the public eye. \\n\\nThat\\'s why the mockery is *more* deserved, or at least legitimately and in an articulable way, less problematic than it would be for a non-celebrity who never consented, doesn\\'t have the PR/legal team/connections to fight it, and could have their actual day job negatively impacted by the attention.',\n",

His pants appeared to be baggy leather. Bieber briefly sat on top of a black Cadillac Escalade, where he waved to screaming fans, before he was chauffeured away...Justin Bieber was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license after police saw the pop star street racing early Thursday morning, Miami Beach police said...A Miami Beach officer saw Bieber driving a yellow Lamborghini in a race against a red Ferrari in a residential area of Miami Beach, Martinez said. The cars were speeding at about 55 to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, he said...Deputies have also investigated reports by Bieber\\'s neighbors that he raced his expensive sports car down the streets of the exclusive Oaks community of Calabasas, California, but no charges ever resulted.[1]\\n\\nThis isn\\'t your average teenage DUI. Your average teenage DUI does not *habitually* race exorbitantly expensive sports cars at dangerous speeds, resist arrest, and wave to screaming fans after leaving jail.\\n\\nThis is someone who projects their persona *to be admired* in public. In one sense, it is *important* for someone with pop-culture-cred to speak on this and express to impressionable young people that this type of behavior is not okay and should be ridiculed.\\n\\nYoung JB fans aren\\'t going to see JB as humbly chastised in a just fashion by the police and courts. You can\\'t teach rebellious, immature people with the assumption that they are going to be rational and reasonable. They don\\'t speak legalese, news reports, or adult responsibility. They speak pop culture, what\\'s hip/cool, and idol worship.\\n\\nYou could even say that it\\'s just icing that JB won\\'t really be hurt by it at the end of the day (which we focused on earlier), plus the fact that he projects an image of himself to be seen. I would say when you do that you bear some responsibility for how you will influence people with your actions and statements and that\\'s part of why he deserves this. \\n\\nWhen fans who will follow JB to the ends of the Earth or more precisely, to the ends of reasonable morality, see his behaviors, they won\\'t necessarily condemn him or have the perspective and maturity to do so. And they won\\'t necessarily even listen to anyone whose job it is to do so (police, judges). But they *might* listen to talk show hosts with comparable levels of pop-culture clout tear down these kinds of behaviors in a language they understand.\\n\\n[1] http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/23/showbiz/justin-bieber-arrest/',\n",

I was a self-harmer for a long time during my younger years and I had a pretty strenuous battle with suicidal ideation during that time as well, culminating in several failed attempts. Currently, I work with people now who are prone to this sort of behavior and I see many examples of it.\\n\\nYes, self-harm can be attention seeking behavior. There are people who do it for the express purpose of garnering attention and sympathy from others. But that should be a red flag of its own; they don\\'t feel comfortable reaching out and asking for moral support and personal affirmation from normal channels so they feel the need to do something to harm themselves to receive that sort of care from others. It\\'s basically someone saying \"I want sympathy, I want support, I want positive attention, but I can\\'t ask for it in a healthy way so I\\'m going to damage myself because that\\'s the only way I know to get that sort of attention.\" \\n\\nThe other way self-harm is used is much more common and that\\'s as a kind of pressure valve. It grounds you, gives you something to focus on other than the emotional pain you\\'re in or jolts feeling to you that you otherwise wouldn\\'t have because you feel so numb on a daily basis. It\\'s a coping mechanism (not a strictly healthy one) but it is often an alternative to suicide for many people. For me personally, it gave great mental clarity and helped slow me down when I was getting overwhelmed and unable to handle even basic tasks because I felt so overloaded. You have this enormous amount of pressure building inside you from the stress of being so emotionally strung out and that pressure has to go somewhere. If you don\\'t get rid of it, you start thinking that killing yourself is the only way to give yourself some peace. Self-harm is that temporary release that keeps things from getting too bad.\\n\\nIt\\'s an extremely difficult mindset to get your head around if you haven\\'t experienced it personally, I understand that. But that doesn\\'t make the struggle that people go through on a daily basis any less difficult. I have a lot of respect for people who\\'ve gone through that kind of place and come out the other side and if taking their scars as a badge of honor for that accomplishment helps keep them going, I\\'m all for people showing them off. Especially considering there are a lot of people who [don\\'t make it](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm). \\n\\nPart of the problem is that \"help\" is an extremely subjective idea and the help a person needs is not always available. I remember being caught cutting my arm when I was in high school, I was hauled up to the counselor\\'s office and interrogated as though I\\'d stolen something or hurt someone else. I was treated as though I\\'d broken the law and it made me fearful to approach the school authorities even if they were actually offering genuine help. Mental health and counseling services are rarely free or low cost enough for many people who need them and the social stigma around people who struggle with mental health issues is pretty mind-blowing.\\n\\nI knew someone that had some very serious problems stemming from a sexual assault she\\'d experienced, spent time in several psych wards with a couple of 72 hour holds. Most people treated her like a bomb that they weren\\'t sure how long the fuse was or like she was made of glass or like she was ready to snap and kill someone at any given moment. We have a really shitty view of people who have these problems; it\\'s not supportive in any constructive way, it\\'s not focused on prevention, it\\'s not founded on any practical ideas of human psychology, it\\'s largely rooted in revenge fantasy, victim blaming, and taking power away from individuals.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t understand the mindset of people who are in these circumstances that\\'s fine, I\\'m the first one to agree that it\\'s not an easy thought process to understand unless you\\'re in the thick of it.

       "  'comments': ['I\\'ll start by saying that I agree with two parts of your view: the term genderqueer is both incendiary and politicized (or at least it often is). For many people I think this is a feature, not a bug, because they want our gender politics and approach to gender to change. I don\\'t think it\\'s *unnecessary,* though, for those who use it. I\\'ll move through your objections.\\n\\n&gt;1) Genderqueer entirely overlaps with Androgyne.\\n\\nAndrogyne and androgynous are generally a description of perception or appearance. A person who is a man or a woman can be described as androgynous: Tilda Swinton, for example, comes to mind. \"Androgynous\" can be applied descriptively when one person is speaking of another. It relates principally to surfaces, to a particular form of expression. For \"androgynous\" to work instead of genderqueer, we\\'d have to change the meaning of the word. \"Genderqueer\" refers not to an appearance or surface but to an identity that is claimed, an interior or personal gender. A person cannot simply be described as genderqueer - they must identify as genderqueer. This is an important distinction, and one that, I think, necessitates a new word.\\n\\n&gt;2) The word queer, while not originally intended as such, has become a slur – and is offensive.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that \"genderqueer\" is only one of several terms used by those who identify outside of the binary system of gender. Others include genderfluid, bigender/trigender/pangender, agender, and simply non-binary.\\n\\nThat said, while of course the term \"queer\" was historically a slur, its rehabilitation both by LGBT people specifically and by discourse more generally has been extensive and thorough. Since the 80s, \"queer\" has gradually lost its pejorative connotations. There are now academic fields like queer theory and queer studies.  It is used widely in activist circles, in LGBT communities, and in popular culture (\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\") and has been for decades. Anyone who would use it as a pejorative now probably thinks of the word \"gay\" as a pejorative as well: indeed, I\\'d argue that \"gay\" gets used as a pejorative far more frequently than \"queer\" these days.\\n\\nLanguage changes over time; words don\\'t have an inherent meaning. Many, many people are comfortable saying \"queer\" and will not take offense if this word is used.\\n\\nUsing the word \"queer\" does indeed call the mind back to an ugly history. But, again, this can be seen as a feature, not a bug. There\\'s is still something provocative about the word \"queer,\" but the term is all about unsettling deep-seated and pernicious heteronormative assumptions, like the idea that gender is binary. \"Queer\" throws a term of oppression back in the oppressor\\'s face, wears it like a badge of honour.\\n\\n&gt; If the goal is to move everyone towards a more gender-neutral society where anyone can express themselves as they see fit; why are progressive movements coining phrases that are steeped in bigotry, intentionally incendiary and divisive? “Positively” politicizing and calling a slur a legitimate gender is wrong. We should be moving towards more neutral, less offensive phrases rather than doubling down on reinventing hateful words.\\n\\nYour argument here comes down to a form of tone policing, which, intentionally or no, tends to benefit those with privilege and stifle those without it.\\n\\nI\\'d argue that your political theory here is flawed as well, as a matter of tactics. Those with social goals disruptive to mainstream thought have rarely achieved those goals through politeness and neutral language. Language that stirs and provokes can force people to confront their own prejudices in a way that non-provocative language does not.\\n\\nI would argue that \"genderqueer\" is not a term of hate, just as \"queer\" is no longer hateful. It serves a function that is indeed political, but which furthers the dismantling of oppressive systems, which is a good political goal. It harms no one, and it is impossible to stop people from using it, so the choice is between embracing it and trying to make peace with it even if it conjures a degree of discomfort, and shaming people who are already too-often marginalized. I think the former is preferable, by far.',\n",

In this sense the original meaning of the word \"queer\" is very appropriate, since it signals someone explicitly marking themselves as apart from the norms that have traditionally shaped sexuality and gender.\\n\\nI do think that discomfort can help rather than hinder social change.

A mutation is a random change that could be good, bad, or neutral.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve been using those two words as synonyms, I think pretty much this whole thread has been based on miscommunication.\\n\\n\"Normal\" is another word that I\\'m not sure means what you think it means. It doesn\\'t just mean something is the statistical norm. Words like \"typical\" or \"common\" or \"average\" mean that. These words have similarly neutral antonyms - words like \"atypical\" and \"uncommon\" and \"unusual.\" Not good or bad, just statistically unlikely.\\n\\n\"Normal\" doesn\\'t mean that. Normal means common, but it also means acceptable and appropriate. Its antonym is the very non-neutral *abnormal,* meaning deviant, a detrimental alteration of the proper state.\\n\\nNobody is trying to convince people that being gay is common. We\\'re trying to make people recognize that it is *normal.* As normal as having red hair or being left-handed. It *is* encoded in our genes, and it\\'s as valuable as all other random variations in the human condition.\\n\\nWould a redhead be just as well off if they didn\\'t inherit mutated genes? Probably. But would the human species be just as well off if *no one* had the redhead MC1R gene? Probably not. Random genetic variation is what keeps a species robust. Genes that are neutral at the moment are beneficial under other circumstances. In environments with very low sunlight, ginger skin = more efficient conversion of sunlight into Vitamin D = less cases of rickets. In environments where very close adult social bonds are immediately necessary for survival, same gender social bonds reinforced by sexual bonds = stronger allies defending and providing for each other = less likely to die.\\n\\n**On mutations;** there are a couple types of mutations. Some happen when sperm or egg are produced; normally they\\'re half of your genes, but sometimes this copying process has random changes. In rare cases these changes are actually on something that matters, and if that sperm or egg is used to make a baby it will affect it. If the change isn\\'t something deadly, and that child grows up and has kids, they may pass the mutation on to some of their kids.\\n\\nThat\\'s the category of \"mutation\" things like red hair fall into. It\\'s not that every red headed person randomly mutated; some ancient ancestor did, and the trait survived thousands of generations. Same-gender desire is similar, though more complex. Social behavior isn\\'t controlled by a single gene, it\\'s many genes in many combinations and in reaction with developmental factors like prenatal hormones. But yes, it can be passed on. It\\'s a variation that arose some ancient pre-human ancestor, probably something way before even mammals evolved. Practically every animal species with two genders shows this trait. The variation probably first appeared shortly after the development of sexual reproduction.\\n\\nOther mutations happen later. If you go sunbathing, solar radiation may cause mutations in your skin cells leading to skin cancer. That won\\'t be passed on to your kids. The radiation affected your skin, not your gonads.\\n\\nBut if you got blasted with a *lot* of radiation, enough that it fucks with your ovaries/testes, it can cause a lot of random mutations in your sperm/eggs.

Anime] and infact, many things from Asian Culture were inspired by western things inversely, For another Example, The Metal Gear Solid Games were [loosely] inspired by James Bond &amp; other Western Action Films, and The Anime Baccanno was inspired by the works of the Quentin Tarantino, an American Film Director.Much of Michael Jackson\\'s work is inspired by both music made by Black &amp; White Musicians. Reminder that the examples I\\'ve given are generally considered by many to be good, so with Writers, Game Developers, Musicians, Media Companies, Etc being forced to only make things that have to do with their culture and the public only able to see things having to do with their culture, there would be less freedom of expression.\\n\\nTo a lesser extent, Cuisine would also be harmed. Let\\'s be real, just about most people like Pizza, but aside from only italians being allowed to eat it, but hey, who the fuck wouldn\\'t be sick of eating the same things every day, \"If your mexican, you have to eat nothing but tacos or spicy food\" \"If your british, you have to eat nothing but fish &amp; chips and tea.\" etc, people would get sick of eating the same shit, and chances are Obesity and or Starvation would increase depending on the culture. \\n\\nand while Travel isn\\'t illegal in your idea, I still doubt many people would Travel due to the fact that They\\'d have to pretty much Act just like their from the country they go to, and more stress might be added if the country doesn\\'t speak the same language as the tourists do, People usually take Vacations to take away the stress from their busy lives, this would generally add onto stress as becoming a tourist would pretty much be the same as becoming an actor.\\n\\nAnd with every country becoming a theocracy, what about the people who aren\\'t religious? what about the people who truly have faith in different religions? are they just forced to convert or be sent to prison?  or even worse, death? I feel a lot more Convert or die stuff would happen ironically in spite of you meaning this to stop behavior like that, I believe with several different religions in a country and plus gun rights, we can prevent convert or die shit via self defense.\\n\\nand speaking of punishments, what would hypothetically happen if someone where to \"Appropriate\" or do something that isn\\'t involved with their culture, but rather a different one. how would they be punished for doing so? \\n\\nMy father brought this up as well as he read your post, he doesn\\'t have a reddit account of his own but I thought I might as well bring it up as it adds to the discussion. \"Some People can\\'t coexist with others, while some want to coexist, rules are never good for everybody. rarely do they exist laws where everyone is pleased, and everyone is a different person, of diverse backgrounds, opinions, etc.\"\\n\\nTo end it off, one last point. there do exist countries that seem to implement your ideas...and those countries happen to generally be Dictatorships, Banana Republics &amp; [Ironically] Islamic Regimes themselves. North Korea for example, censors foreign media, bans all religions[which is mainly due to them teaching the public that the kims are God-Like figures themselves.], among other things.

Yes people's social circles expand, and change, and occasionally someone comes in that lets you tap into an entirely new social circle, but you really don't have a ton of control over that kind of thing.\\n\\nGoing out to a club guarantees that there will be a good number of people you've never met before.

You don't ever have to see them again unless you want to.

The assurance of a good night is higher back at home, but the odds of a great night are higher if you go out.\\n\\nAs I get older, I find a lot less of the unexpected happens at house parties and when I go out.

The following are the biggest cities in each of the Scadanavian countries:\\n\\n* [Stockholm, Sweden - 1.37 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_Sweden_by_population)\\n* [Oslo, Norway - 1.1 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_Norway_by_population)\\n* [Copenhagen, Denmark - 1.2 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Denmark_by_population)\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that the next largest city in any of these nations is [Göteborg, Sweden with 549,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_Sweden_by_population). After that, there\\'s not a city of over 300,000 in any of them. Contrast that with the [64 cities in the US with a population over 300,000 or the 8 cities larger than Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population).\\n\\nPoverty and crime (especially gun and violent crime) both tend to skyrocket in urban areas, even as education plummets. I could not find any concrete numbers on this, but I\\'d imagine that if you removed all major urban populations (maybe every city with more than 1 million) from various metrics used to look at a nation\\'s success, you would see many of those numbers look far more positive than they otherwise would. Maybe this can be filed under the US being large in size and population, but I think the sheer dominance of urban areas in the US should be filed as its own reason.\\n\\nThe obvious question that then arises is then, \"Why are urban areas in the US often very awful?\" I would posit that it\\'s a cultural issue as much as anything, both within the cities themselves and the culture of the US as a whole. Many urban populations in the US devalue things like succeeding in high school. These values are passed on to the next generation, and so on and so forth. Listen to Kendrick Lamar\\'s *Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City* or *To Pimp a Butterfly* to get an idea of what that might look like (Lamar was raised in Compton). Meanwhile, poverty in urban areas is stigmitized (especially by the Republican Party), and there\\'s little effort to go in and help urban populations get out of the cycle of poverty and lack of education. We throw urban populations welfare checks without doing anything to attempt to fix the problem.\\n\\n\"Fixing\" urban areas wouldn\\'t solve all of the US\\' shortcomings in international measures of happiness, education, and violence, but it would go a long, long way. The US may be doing pretty good for its size overall, but I don\\'t think the \"instant disadvantage\" comes just from size.

To me, One More Light is a decent pop album, but it lacks what most Linkin Park fans love about Linkin Park. A Thousand Suns was different and atmospheric, but it still gave every member of the band a chance to shine. Chester sounds great as always, but he only gets to show off a fraction of his range. Mike only gets one rap verse and it's nothing extraordinary compared to his rapping on Living Things or A Thousand Suns. And other than Joe, the rest of the band is barely there on at least half if not most of the album. That was never a problem with the band before. Even on their primarily electronic stuff, you still had memorable, driving instrumental tracks. On the other hand, could you tell me from memory what the instrumental track to Heavy, Halfway Right, or Sorry For Now sounds like? Go back one album to The Hunting Party and it's clear you're getting the full Linkin Park experience. Still catchy, still atmospheric and genre-bending, but there's still some high energy musicianship throughout the whole album.

It was a privilege reserved only for the very wealthy or the very talented, to actually undergo higher education. \\n\\nTherefore, you needed a job, and with a job, you got your own place, and you got your shit together, and you got married, and you had kids.\\n\\nThe world was, fundamentally, a much less complex place. There wasn\\'t a need for many of the skills you need nowadays. \\n\\nWhen you complain to old 80-year-old grandpa about how hard it is to get a job, he just can\\'t understand that yes, it **is** actually much more difficult to get a job now than it was \"back in the day\".\\n\\nWhen old Grandpa starts talking about how this generation just wants to piggyback off of mum and dad\\'s back, and that they\\'re nearly 30 and still haven\\'t gotten married, and the world is going to shit because of these lazy young uns, Grandpa is coming from a fundamentally different frame of reference.\\n\\nIt was easier to get jobs, the minimum wage was better than it is today (adjusted for inflation), there was much less need to spend on expensive hardware (computers, notebooks, cellphones, etc...) to stay in touch with the world, and, overall, entertainment was actually quite a bit cheaper too.\\n\\nEverything was much, much less complicated.\\n\\nSure, there were wars going on. But it was no WWII. It wasn\\'t *that* bad. By the time Vietnam rolled in, Grandpa was already too old to get drafted for the war effort. That, and Grandpa was too young to get drafted for WWII. Sure, he knew plenty of folks who did fought in WWII, including his dad, and some more folks who even went back for the Korean War, and met many friends who lost their boys and girls to Nam.\\n\\nBut back home, it was quiet. Yeah, the Cold War gave everyone the shivers every once in a while, but nobody ever **really** happened back home, it was always quiet back home. \\n\\nSo Grandpa got a really sweet deal on the mortgage of his lovely house with Grandma, at much more reasonable pre real-state bubble prices, and got a sweet deal on his pension, reasonable enough health care, and witnessed the world change while he himself didn\\'t change.\\n\\nAnd now Grandpa complains about everything and gets to feel like a successful story, a know-it-all who feels entitled to talk down to anyone and everyone in the whole family. \\n\\nWhat do i mean by all this?\\n\\nIn many ways, yeah, society has gotten better. But in many other ways, it has also gotten worse. It\\'s now harder to find jobs, you spend much more time and money on education, housing prices are up, health care prices are up, and if you were born any later than the 80\\'s, you aren\\'t even guaranteed to **ever** retire if you don\\'t start saving up ASAP. Divorce rates are up, child births are down, the world is undergoing a **massive** cultural/religious war between the west christian world and Islam...

I'm not saying it was a clever thing to do, or even the right thing, but those lines were drawn up,for some part, in an effort to break up the thousand years of war between these people.\\n\\nSecondly, there were Christians living in these countries - Pakistan, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Palestine. Where are the Christian extremists so incensed at the west for their actions here? Where are the Christian suicide bombers? The Christians and Muslims living in these areas would have experienced the exact same things - the same lack of education, the same material deprivation, speaking the same language. The only difference is that the Christians, and other minorities, have been outright slaughtered or driven out of these places by Muslims.\\n\\nAnd inspite of that, Christians haven't started suicide bombing or creating terrorist organisations en masse.\\n\\nFurthermore, for your argument to hold validity - that of poor Western intervention, bombing civilians, power vacuums etc, you would have to defend why reactions are different in Islamic countries than elsewhere.\\n\\nFor example, how many countries in Latin America hold legitimate grievances against the U.S? Where are the Latin American suicide bombers? If mere oppression is enough, where are the Native Indian suicide bombers? Why is it that Tibetans haven't been suicide bombing the Chinese, but instead, have been practicing self-imolation - something that can be entirely explained given their culture/religion?\",\n",

Report on the data - that's a fact report that is easily sourced and peer reviewed. Make conclusions based on data and you've got a situation in which journalism (imo only of course) can reach a much higher level than it currently resides. Be open about the fact that it is an opinion piece, cite your data, and encourage discussion and panels from *that starting point*.\\n\\n\\nThere's no set reason that 24 cable news has to be sensationalist tripe to keep an audience.

A scientist who is skeptical of climate change will look at a given set of data and use that data to reinforce an opinion.

Make conclusions based on data and you\\'ve got a situation in which journalism (imo only of course) can reach a much higher level than it currently resides.\\n\\nThat sounds good in theory, but it has a few big problems\\n\\n- Most people are not sophisticated enough to understand just the data.  People watch the news to have data distilled down into conclusions and synopses for them.  When I watch the news, I don\\'t want the transcript of the G7 summit - I want highlights of what was discussed and what the outcomes were.  Same with anything scientific\\n\\n- This assumes that all the data points to a single conclusion.  Very often, there are conflicting data sets that point to entirely different outcomes.  Our climate change deniers have data to support their assertions.  So do the lizardmen believers.  It may not be good data, but its still data.\\n\\n- Data and analysis can be biased as well.  If you go back to the \"chocolate diet\" study, the journalist in question specifically engaged in [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) to get the results.  He was doing it to prove a point about the issues with treating science as fact, but it doesn\\'t change the fact that his data did support his conclusion.  What he reported was 100% factual and representative of the data he observed.  Similar to my first point, it is too big an ask for the average consumer to be able to decide what sample size or number of reproducible studies is sufficient to draw a conclusion.\\n\\n&gt;It can even have a clear message that is biased toward a particular viewpoint. I\\'d just like to see them own those biases.\\n\\nEvery viewpoint is biased.  Bias can not be completely removed, nor can it ever be completely owned.  The very stories they choose to report vs the ones the choose not to have bias baked into them.  Choosing to report a positive story about one candidate and a negative story about another is bias, even if they are both 100% factually correct. It is never possible to present unbiased reporting.  Rather than trying to expose every piece of it, we should just accept that all reporting is inherently biased and not take it at face value.\\n\\n&gt; If consensus is disagreement, that disagreement should be (and in the case of climate science at least overwhelmingly is) a rebuttal of the conclusion either done through identifying a flaw in methodology or in the jump from data to conclusion. \\n\\nAs I said before, the data is rarely that cut and dry.  More often than not, you have two data sets that say conflicting things, both with sound methodologies.  Often the issue is with the amount of data collected rather than an issue with the experiment itself.  You can go to libraries and find reams of research supporting [phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology).  From that research, you would conclude that phrenology is legitimate science.  It wasn\\'t until much more research was done that we saw it for the pseudo-science that it really is.  Science can never be taken as \"fact\" - it can always be wrong, no matter how much evidence we have to support it.\\n\\n&gt;This amount of rigor simply doesn\\'t exist in any meaningful way with regard to journalism.\\n\\nThat is a matter of how you define rigor and fact.

If you start applying some pseudo-factual label to that, it can be even more dangerous.  What if I, as a deeply biased news director, decide only to show positive stories about Clinton and negative stories about Trump; every clip of Clinton is her saying good, kind things and every clip of Trump is him saying mean, racist things.  By the letter of the rules, this would be \"news\" in your system - it is the reporting of just plain facts as everything I am reporting actually happened.

       "   \"You seem to be confusing assault rifles and assault weapons which happen to be rifles. Assault rifles are automatic rifles (i.e. you can hold the trigger and fire more than one bullet). The assault weapons that happen to be rifles are rifles that have some of a list of largely superficial qualities including a black plastic body, telescoping sight, pistol grip, etc. These are not properties that increase the stopping power of the weapon. Arguably they make the weapon more effective because they make it easier to handle, aim, etc. That said, would you rather a random person using a rifle to have one that's heavier, harder to handle and aim, etc? Wouldn't that be more likely to cause accidents?\\n\\nAlso, a few things about the numbers you mentioned. Changing a magazine would take a trained person less than 10 seconds, and (barring perhaps a bolt-action rifle) *any* person could fire *any* gun more than once every two seconds. A practiced person can empty a 30-round magazine in a semi-automatic weapon (one pull = on bullet) in under 10 seconds. Machine guns, on the other hand, can empty a 30-round clip in closer to three seconds. Granted, neither of these are useful things to do in virtually any situations because you won't be able to hit anything. \\n\\nOn the topic of large magazines, why would you need to be able to fire that many bullets without reloading anyway? Well, a few reasons. Maybe I'm hunting, I startle a moose, and it charges at me. You'd better believe I want as many chances to hit the fucker as I can before he gets to me, especially since hitting it once may not stop it. Alternatively, maybe someone broke into my house and they have threatened to hurt me or my family. Again, I want as many bullets at my disposal as possible before I give him a ten-second window in which I'm defenseless, if I even have back-up magazines on me. And again, remember that hitting him once may not stop him. \\n\\nThere's a reason people like these weapons; they're very good at what they do, and if you're going to do those things you want to be able to do them well. They can be easier to use or aim than traditional-looking, heavy, non-customized weapons, and there are legitimate reasons for wanting to be able to use them well than just going on murder sprees that happen maybe once per year and are horrific but statistically irrelevant and impossible to stop without unreasonable sanctions. \",\n",

If we also prevent second-generation immigrants from running, where do we draw the line and why? Should third generation be allowed? How about fourth, fifth, sixth, etc? People can still have friends, family, and relatives living in other countries especially when modern society is such a global society. Also culture can be passed down from generation-to-generation resulting in a sense of affiliation with the country that that culture originates from.\\n\\nHow about American-born citizens whose one parent is American and the other foreign. They will likely have ties to the foreign parent's native country and yet they are eligible for presidency. Should we also ban them too? What about their children? This also applies to American who have close relatives born in other countries. \\n\\nWhat about American-born citizens who have lived the majority of their lives in a foreign country. Why are they not banned from running?\\n\\nI strongly believe that in today's global society, it's hard to find someone who is truly objective and only has affiliations solely with America (which by the way is the land of the immigrants).

Why not let the public choose through voting?\\n\\n&gt;The United States needs to elect a person to President who it feels has the US' interest at heart and only the US' interests at heart\\n\\nSee my argument above, especially the last paragraph, which also applies to his point. Why do we not let the potential foreign-born candidates campaign and try to convince the public that they really do have America's best interest at heart? After assessing all the facts and claims, the public can vote to let this person become president or not. After all, it is the public's responsibility to be well-informed on all the candidates before casting their votes\\n\\n&gt;While there is also no way to check for that, the inability to filter him out as a candidate does not strengthen the argument that you should be a candidate.\\n\\nSince we cannot check, this places people like me at an unfair disadvantage.

If all you knew was where I was born without also knowing the type of person I am and my past accomplishments, it is near impossible for you say if I would be an effective leader or not. Telling people they can or cannot become president simply because of birthplace is ludicrous since the way you were raised and your life experiences have such a tremendous impact on your belief system (moral, ethical, religious, political, etc) and perception.    \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Lets say that I drive a black sedan.  I'm speeding through traffic and a police officer spots me.  Because my car is so common, once I turn the corner, he can no longer distinguish me from anyone else and decides not to issue a ticket.  You drive a red sedan.  You're in the same situation but even after turning the corner, he spots you easily, and issues a full ticket.  My argument is that the fact that I got lucky and avoided the ticket does not mitigate the police officer's responsibility from issuing you a ticket.  You cannot make a strong argument that you do not deserve a ticket for speeding because I lucked out.  The only argument that you *can* make is that the police need better tools to catch us both.\\n\\nSimilarly, the US agenda is to elect people with only it's best interest in mind and immigrants are *decidedly* not in that group.  Your brother is in the same situation you are, but he drives a black sedan.

I would even call it discriminatory on the same level as racism since you cannot control neither your skin color nor your birthplace and neither is directly correlated with being a good or bad leader\\n\\nThe problem is that you're using concepts you really don't understand.  Institutionalized racism stops a person from advancing in all forms of their life.  Everything from the jobs they can get to the people they can date to the places they can live and the education they can acquire.  It's a HUGE thing.

       "   \"&gt;You cannot make a strong argument that you do not deserve a ticket for speeding because I lucked out. The only argument that you can make is that the police need better tools to catch us both.\\n\\nThis might not be a perfect but I'll try to continue your analogy. In your analogy, the law states that no one should speed at all. If you speed (if you're not natural-born), you'll always face the legal consequences if caught (you cannot run for presidency if it is found that you're not natural-born). However speeding isn't necessarily a bad thing. You can speed but still drive safe (you can be foreign-born but still be a great leader). Of course the contrapositive is true too. You can stay within the speed limit but that doesn't necessarily mean you're a safe driver (you can be natural-born, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be good leader). Instead of it being speeding =  always bad (foreign-born = always bad president), I'm trying to argue for unsafe driving regardless of speed = bad (bad person regardless of birthplace = bad president). You can choose to speed or not speed as long as you're being a safe driver (you can be natural-born or foreign-born as long as you can be an effective leader). This similar to Germany's autobahn, no speed limit.  \\n\\nIn this analogy, how will you determine if a driver is acting unsafe or not? You let the police officer make the judgement call (letting the public vote) after assessing all the facts such as how fast you were going, you're driving style, current weather/traffic conditions, etc.\\n\\nAgain, this isn't a perfect analogy but essentially I'm trying to argue for a change in the law. Regardless of your birthplace, you try to convince a country of 300 million people that you can be an great leader and have America's best intentions at heart. If the public is convinced and you get the majority vote, then you should be the president. Let me know if this wasn't clear and I'll try to clarify it\\n\\n&gt;No one said they need to be objective. In fact the candidate should be 100% subjective with an unwavering love for America.\\n\\nBy objective I meant it as in not having any bias towards any other country other than America. Sorry for the lack of clarity. \\n\\n&gt;Because the position to be filled is President of a country. The place where they were born and the job of protecting that place are inextricable\\n\\nJust because you are born in a certain place doesn't automatically make you more/less qualified. A person who lives and is raised in America from close to birth but is not natural-born has very similar experiences and familiarity of American culture as any natural-born. Yet they are excluded from the presidency. Can you list any particular benefits to being natural-born that a foreign-born raised in America does not have, other than saying that it's just better?  \\n\\n&gt;To compare your inability to run for President to racism is so far beyond insulting.\\n\\nI apologize if that was insulting/offensive to you or anyone else reading this.\\n \",\n",
       "   \"\\n\\n\\n&gt;  Can you list any particular benefits to being natural-born that a foreign-born raised in America does not have, other than saying that it's just better?\\n\\nI can only list one; a complete lack of competition in terms of allegiance. You personally may feel absolutely zero allegiance to your home country, but this is - by far - not the norm.  I for one, still feel very strongly about my home country.  In every job where a conflict of interest is in place, it is expected that the establishment remove the conflict.  So police officers cannot guard the neighborhoods in which they live.  Judges need to recuse themselves from a trial if the evidence is too close to their personal life. Teachers who have failed a student don't teach that student the following year (unless there are exceptions like lack of finance).  Soldiers cannot date one another (for fear that the life of that soldier will become more valuable than the mission).  This is a general rule applied to *all* workforces.  There are many competent and good people, but a conflict of interest is more trouble than can be accepted.\\n\\n\\n&gt;  You can choose to speed or not speed as long as you're being a safe driver\\n\\nI understand your point about the way the world *could work*.  But there is a reason that it doesn't work that way in speeding either.  We have a country of 3K+ miles wide and 50 states.  There is a different population density everywhere you go.  Yet our speed limits are consistent throughout the entire country.  Why? Because when you govern you have to set a rule that protects everyone against everyone else.  Not corner cases.  \",\n",

This is flawed logic.  Immigrants come and go for a variety of reasons and form allegiances to different places.  Not to mention that an American living in India is not as likely to form a bond as an Indian living in India.  Not only is a person more willing, but the people of the country are more willing.  So while an American *can* also form bonds in a foreign nation it is significantly less likely than a foreigner from another nations forming bonds within their home country.\"]},\n",

       "   '&gt;Under actual patriarchy, default father custody was the norm.\\n\\nNope. Even when the law favored fathers as the legal custodians, the mother was presumed to have the right to custody of even an illegitimate child as against the putative father. (Minnesota. Olson v. Johnson, 23 Minn. 301, 303, 1877 WL 3857 (1877)) Additionally, before any sort of tender years doctrine was put in place, some courts awarded custody of very young children to the mother. An 1813 Pennsylvania case awarded the mother custody of two girls ages ten and six saying that \"it appears to us, that considering their tender age, they stand in need of that kind of assistance, which can be afforded by none so well as a mother.\" Commonwealth v. Addicks, 5 Binn. 520, 521, 1813 WL 2204 (Pa. 1813).\\n\\nThere was more to the move than mere feminism too. During the 19th century, the functions of the family changed as the United States moved from a rural, agrarian society to an urban, industrialized society. Instead of being a self-contained economic unit engaged in farming, mothers stayed home to tend to children while fathers worked long hours outside of the home. (Plus the theory of women as nurturers was pervasive in society: Justice Bradley\\'s concurring opinion in Bradwell v. People of State of Illinois, 83 U.S. 130, 141, 21 L. Ed. 442, 446, 1872 WL 15396 (1872), stated, \"The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother.\" He doesn\\'t sound like much of a *feminist* saying that...) Women became more vocal about their legal rights, with a Declaration of Equality at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention. Also during the 19th century, perceptions that a child of eight was a miniature adult changed and childhood came to be seen as a separate stage of life. Because a child needed nurturing, protection and preparation for adult life, public education, labor laws and other child protection laws appeared.\\n\\nIronically counter to your actual point, the original tender years doctrine came out of Louisiana, providing as early as 1827 that the mother ought to nourish and rear her children who are under three years of age **and the father should care for those above that age.** This was no feminist victory.\\n\\nNow, you\\'re right, though, this did lead to a presumption of fitness on the part of the mother to care for the child up until around the 1970\\'s, but since then, aside from Louisiana, Tennessee and Florida, the states have all declared the doctrine unconstitutional. Those states that still mention tender years do so either as a tie breaker to give the mother custody if all other evidence is considered equal or an indirect preference for the mother using age and sex of child as factors. Not to mention, it\\'s *only relevant to very young children*. The cutoff is effectively the age the kid goes to school.\\n\\nIf a court awards custody for sex-based reasons, there\\'s plenty any attorney can do to fight it. Honestly, there\\'s a ton of precedence.  Johnson v. Adair, 884 So. 2d 1169 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 2004) (trial court erred when it based its decision granting mother primary residential responsibility for out-of-wedlock child on the child\\'s age where statute provided that the father would be given the same consideration, irrespective of the age or sex of the child). In re Marriage of Bush, 170 Ill. App. 3d 523, 121 Ill. Dec. 357, 525 N.E.2d 163 (2d Dist. 1988) (focus on maternal nurturing was tantamount to improper imposition of tender years doctrine). Russell v. Russell, 782 S.W.2d 406 (Mo. Ct. App. W.D. 1989) (reversed custody order to mother based on tender years where mother was completely irresponsible and father could provide more stable home). \\n\\nWe base decisions of custody on the subjective standard of \"child\\'s best interests.\" The ALI\\'s Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution § 2.12(1)(b) (2002) prohibits a court from considering the gender of either the parent or the child in determining custody arrangements. \\n\\nFor more information, read \"Child Custody Practice and Procedure\" - Linda Elrod\\n\\nI work at a matrimonial firm.

I personally am a fairly moderate MRA (and a fairly moderate feminist, believe it or not the two things aren't mutually exclusive), but would love to have seen some refutation going on. There doesn't seem to be any, and in a subreddit where the idea is refutation of points that's a bit disappointing.\\n\\nI think that it's very easy to see something like the OP's statement and jump to the idea that they are opposing women's equality, while for many people the practice of feminism (as opposed to the ideal) is not about equality at all. \",\n",

Sure, you can argue that Andrea Dworkin was messed up, but that doesn't mean that all feminist thinkers are messed up, or that most are. You can cite the Ms. Magazine study on campus rape as a movement using horrible stats to back up a point of view, but there are plenty of feminists who don't base their viewpoint on that study... I personally kind of believe that we should look at people based on the beliefs they profess, not the label they give those beliefs. Some feminists are bad people, some MRA's are bad people.

What you do not understand is that there is a media war and that stats can easily be misinterpreted to say anything you want.  All of the blog reports you have read about immigrants not hurting US employment have HORRIBLE flaws in their logic.  Those arguments are made lacking even a basic understanding of economics.\\n\\nYou are truly naive to believe this kind of propaganda.  Here is a rebuttal to a few of the arguments you have fallen for:\\n\\nFailing Pensions, SSI:  Any sort of issue about the government not having money to pay for things comes from one simple source:  Wealth concentration.  The government prints money, the 1% scheme to get all that money back in the same accounts.  Printing money devalues everyone\\'s savings, lowers the buying power of the dollar.  Half of these money printing initiatives involve dumping money in the hand of shell corporations that manage to sneak it back into billionaire hands pretty quickly, instead of putting it in the hands of the people or the government.  The end result is no one can afford anything except people that were already rich.  That is why college now costs a near life debt when it used to be subsidized by the government for the good of the economy.  The same goes for your \"failed pensions\".  Well planned inflation caused that.  \\n\\nWanna know something that causes mass wealth concentration?  Labor/Buying power arbitrage.  Make something with really cheap labor, sell it at an enormous markup, concentrate the difference in the account of an already ultra rich billionaire.  Great way to suck the life out of any economy.\\n\\nThe idea that illegal cheap labor or Hostage1b labor doesn\\'t drive down wages is utterly ridiculous.  None of those arguments even remotely consider macroeconomic effects.  A huge influx of people willing to work twice the hours for half the pay will of course drive down wages, but the studies you look at only consider the compared wages between citizens and illegals at any given time.\\n\\nTHIS IS A CIRCULAR FUCKING ARGUMENT.  The wages were already driven down by the massive influx.  You can\\'t then compare the wages of the two and call it science.  If those people were never there the wages would be much higher and the economy would be much healthier because of distributed instead of concentrated wealth.  \\n\\nYour sources are just stupid and wrong.',\n",

The probably with this type of argument is that it essentially boils down to saying that X group has it good *relatively speaking*. This observation is absolutely correct, but it ignores the fact that most social justice movements are focused on building their vision of an ideal society. i.e. They believe that every instance of oppression should be fought, no matter how small. Telling these people to suck it up is probably one of the fastest ways to be dismissed even if your points are valid.\\n\\n\\n&gt; Not to say that women have it perfect here, but the problems with being a women in modern America stems less from oppression and men and more from scumbags and assholes.\\n\\nAgain, this is factually correct, but it misses some potentially valuable context. These scumbags and assholes exist in undeniably large numbers relative to what they \"should.\" The fact that their conduct is perpetuated generation after generation, despite most people looking down on it is curious. One interpretation of this phenomena is that society facilitates these behaviors by not adequately discouraging them, thus framing the narrative as one in which women are systemically subjected such aggressions. Personally, I think culture(s) are a much bigger factor than is generally given credit, but the systemic aspect is hard to deny.\\n\\n&gt; Basically, my two biggest issues with the feminist movement is that men are being labelled the same as the scumbags and assholes causing problems, and calling women oppressed.\\n\\nThe first of these has little to do with the CMV, IMO. As a dude I empathize with the notion that feminism sucks at addressing men and male issues in a non-accusatory manner, but I think ultimately the \"women are oppressed\" narrative can exist even without directly addressing men. Today\\'s popular feminism is largely based off of Marxism (substitute \"patriarchy\" for \"bourgeoisie\" and \"women\" for \"proletariat\" and things make about as much sense). Because patriarchy is defined by most reasonable people as the systemic forces that advantage men at the expense of women, men don\\'t actually have to be active in it (and it is in fact perpetuated by men AND women). What this means is that women can get fucked over without you actually being complicit in it. \\n\\nDo women actually get fucked over? To varying degrees. Certainly things like access to birth control and abortions are examples of women being arbitrarily restricted by society. Social norms have, until very recently, prevented women from excelling in certain professional fields. I think that much we can all agree on. While compared to, say, not being able to go to school or leave the house without a make escort those issues are relatively small, they *are* still issues that women face. What I think helps make this all a lot more digestible to men is a completion of the patriarchy theory that feminists are really, really shit at explaining: while women are oppressed in these ways, men are also oppressed in other ways. As a dude you\\'re subject to social norms about emotional expression, you\\'re fucked in court (compared to a female charged with the same offense) and your reproductive rights end at the beginning of your orgasm. *These issues are also systemic.* \\n\\nIt comes down to one really sad reality: there are a lot of angry/hurt/upset/whatever feminists out there. This leads to toxic, unapologetic discourse that hurts men and only marginally benefits women. The thing is, though, the things they argue against actually have a degree of merit to them and that\\'s why feminism is so popular among women. Even if they don\\'t want to see it or are unaware of it or whatever, it does a decent job of highlighting issues than men face, as well. Relatively speaking, we\\'re *all* oppressed. \"All\" just so happens to include women.\\n\\nTL;DR Feminists are really bad at discourse, but there is some merit to their arguments. Even though they mostly talk about women, their ideological framework is capable of simultaneously accommodating issues men face, as well.

That said, the magnitude of these things gets very small, very quickly to the point where, at this point in time in our culture, people will just tell you to put up with it. Who knows, though? A decade from now people may protest against mechanical pencils because they create a hostile work environment when their lead breaks.\\n\\nJust as a sidenote: I\\'m just presenting the theoretical side of things. I don\\'t actually think a lot of things popular feminism argues against are that bad; just trying to illuminate some of the ideas behind it in an accessible way to CYV.',\n",
       "   '&gt; It comes down to one really sad reality: there are a lot of angry/hurt/upset/whatever feminists out there. This leads to toxic, unapologetic discourse that hurts men and only marginally benefits women\\n\\nYour entire response clearly articulates my own position much better than I have ever seen it articulated.\\n\\nIt\\'s frustrating because I\\'m actually very sympathetic to the goals of feminism, but I frequently find myself in disagreement with - or else completely unable to see myself, or my circumstances, reflected-in - feminist articles and literature that I come across.\\n\\nThe \"Not all men\" meme is a perfect example. While I think its intention is to avoid derailing otherwise topical discussions, to me it always comes off as a thought-killing dismissal of potentially valid objections to gross or inaccurate generalizations.',\n",
       "   'Yeah, it\\'s taken me a while to sort through things (part of me still has trouble believing I wrote that much in defense of feminism lol), but the conclusion that I\\'ve come to is that feminism itself is pretty cool, but the discourse associated with it is horrid. I can appreciate the sentiments behind a lot of it (I\\'m black, I \"get\" the minority angle), but even when it\\'s not super abrasive it has a tendency to come off as intellectually dishonest (\"1 in 4\", \"women make 70% of men\" etc) which is a huge turn off. ',\n",
       "   'I\\'m also a man, and feminists talk about the way that our society/patriarchy hurts men all the time. I see it basically daily. it\\'s a serious stretch to say we\\'re \"oppressed\" in at all the same way, though -- the issues negatively affecting men are very serious (at times deadly so, when it comes to toxic masculinity), but it is disingenuous to frame the situation like that.\\n\\nI also seriously struggle to see where I am hurt at all, in any way, by \"feminist discourse,\" so I invite you to explain!',\n",
       "   'Eh, they do but in my experience it airways turns into them explaining how a make problem is really just another example of us oppressing women. Take for example a system that generally awards children to the mother in the case of divorce. I\\'ve seen men complain about that only to have someone chime in with how that\\'s caused by us viewing women as caretakers etc and we should really feel bad for women in those situations. Or we don\\'t view women as capable of working dangerous jobs, hence why men account for almost all workplace deaths. Changing the subject of harm away from the group who\\'s concerned (in this case men) is a really shitty way of getting across the message \"we care!\" Much in the same way that many feminists react poorly to \"but not all men,\" this kind of way of addressing very valid concerns comes off as if you\\'re trying to co-op an issue to forward your own goals/feel as if you hold the moral high ground  instead of to help people who are legitimately suffering.\\n\\nI appreciate the invitation, but I\\'m not the most qualified person to give that expansion; I am decidedly not a feminist and while I have a pretty good understanding of the theories at its core I don\\'t buy into a lot of them. As a dude, I don\\'t feel hurt in pretty much any way feminism says I\\'m oppressed. I express myself freely, don\\'t feel overwhelmingly alone in life and am comfortable in my relative masculinity. \\n\\nEdit: I just re-read your post and realized I misinterpreted it. Gonna leave the previous part as is because it\\'s somewhat relevant.\\n\\nAnyway.\\n\\nMy point was that men and women are *not* oppressed in the same ways, but that they are both still oppressed. It comes down to the perspective from which you approach the issue and, as a culture, we\\'re really bad at operating outside of black-white morality so it\\'s not surprising that it often feels as if there\\'s only room for one narrative. Right now the popular is women who feel (rightly so) feel stifled by society in their attempts to achieve the same kind of success that men have historically obtained with ease. When you look at our society from that lends, who earns more, who has more economic/political authority, who goes on to start the most businesses etc, damn right women have the short end of the stick. But that\\'s not the only valid way of looking at how our society works. \\n\\nA couple days ago I had a discussion on /r/FeMRADebates about gender roles and respective standards of \"success\" for men and women. As a guy, pretty much every \"path\" to \"success\" boils down to \"get a fucking job that support you/things your mate/family need.\" For women, if you are physically attractive what you do with your life is much less important. Typically this devolves into an argument about how superficial we are when it comes to women, but it\\'s only that way if you come into the conversation valuing stereotypically \"male\" indicators of success as substantial. However, personally speaking, a lot more goes into \"looking good\" than simply clothes or make-up; it\\'s necessary to hold and cultivate a sense of personal aesthetic that isn\\'t easy to develop. Playing with different looks for different occasions and audiences can have a powerful effect on how you\\'re received and I admire women that do it well. To be, a life of perfecting my various looks wouldn\\'t be at all superficial, and given that I\\'m not motivated at all by prestige and money that kind of lifestyle isn\\'t unappealing. But you would never hear this side of things when having a conversation about oppression. As long as one discourse dominates the discussion, of course it\\'s going to sound like one side has it worse.\\n\\nYou personally may not be hurt by feminist discourse, but to say that it isn\\'t hurtful isn\\'t quite true. The vast majority of it is perfectly fine, but the way in which sexual assault is addressed is just awful. It\\'s framed as an epidemic when it\\'s seen a steady decline over the years. Assailants are depicted almost exclusively as men (even in non-hetero relationships, lesbian couples are rarely shown), which creates horrible stigma for men. Women are told to be on guard constantly for people trying to slip things in their drinks/take advantage of them when the former rarely happens and the vast majority of rapists are someone the victim knows. In aggregate what this does is create a culture of fear in women that is unwarranted. I get this doubly as a tall black guy at night. It\\'s incredibly hurtful to see someone go out of their way to avoid you because they think you\\'re predatory, especially in somewhere as stupid as a grocery store. When I go to required anti-domestic violence seminars? Bam I\\'m being told not to beat up women even though I\\'ve never laid a finger on anyone in my life. And to top it all off, I can be expelled from school for rape without it ever being proven in court. This is a culture that\\'s constantly telling me I\\'m one step away from victimizing someone. That I\\'m someone to be afraid of. That when I see people purposely avoid me it\\'s *my fault* for not making them feel comfortable. These issues are really salient for my demographic (black college kid), so I get it if you don\\'t feel very affected, but I assure you popular feminism is really good at making men my age feel shitty about themselves.',\n",

Sometimes overly-white-centric, due to Reddit\\'s upvote / hot page model. I tend to find myself a little alone in there when it comes to certain circumstances of rape or mothers\\' rights, and sometimes they have some terrible, terrible people (I have no idea if they are subscribers) who espouse views that are discriminatory against Muslims.  It\\'s not as male-friendly as you or I might like, though I\\'m inclined to see why, usually (when people think it detracts from the topic  -- so often these aren\\'t the OPs). In a way it speaks more to the lack of comfort men may feel in what\\'s being offered to them as their movement or perceptions of who will accept them. I feel bad when they feel that their gender matters (because you shouldn\\'t have to preface any abuse you suffered with gender, nor should you have to offer it up as if it makes your opinion on an issue less relevant and that you\\'re sorry for it -- we have Michelle Bachmann, gender is not the metric we need), but I see why they also want to say, \"we have a common goal, women aren\\'t the only ones suffering from this cultural imbalance, and we can work together on this.\"\\n\\nProbably feminism\\'s top issue is that equality isn\\'t exactly what it means -- there are definitely drawbacks to being a man, and the solution for society isn\\'t to shove everyone on the ground in a race to the bottom. Feminism shouldn\\'t have to give away privileges (though that may happen as an effect of progress), necessarily, to be the same as men, when it can improve the way an issue is approached for everyone. I\\'d love it if there were a better approach to child support or spousal abuse or whatnot -- women come in all shapes and sizes, from all circumstances and backgrounds, and not everyone is nurturing, or a good person. Some women can kill a man faster than he can reach for a door, and some women throw up when a child is in the room. If we can become less structured (which I feel is feminist) in how we approach gender, I think women\\'s issues can quickly and wholeheartedly be viewed as people\\'s issues.\\n\\nAnyway, sorry for the rant. It was more like a bunch of musing. I definitely have a brand of feminism that isn\\'t fully represented by what I see, and I do try to be considerate of men -- I have men in my life and I don\\'t think of them as any different from me, so I want to give them the rights they deserve.']},\n",

The highly specialized knowledge of the justices allowed the productions of a body of patent law that is *extremely* technical, specialized, particular and inaccessible. It is more important for the law to be usable by other judges and lawyers (or even laypeople and business-people) than that it be precisely optimized.

Basically, I agree, but I don\\'t think either group is \"right\" or \"better\" ; both are misfocused.\\n\\nThe problematic part of this equation in both groups is that they focus on who is the most maligned by society at large.  Feminists I\\'ve met (and read online) spend quite a bit of time trying to prove how bad off women have it (wage gap, discrimination, under-representation, not to mention rape) ; MRAs do the same (justice system imbalances, under-representation, not to mention rape).\\n\\nThis shifts the argument from \"How do we make things better\" to \"Why we focus on our group\".  By positioning one group (A) as the focus, it immediately creates counter-positions (B, C, D) because A doesn\\'t cover what B/C/D also cover.  By focusing on everyone you alienate fewer people and can still focus on helping whomever you choose, which has largely the same effect, but now we\\'re all working on the same problem.\\n\\nGender issues are inextricably linked to both genders irrespective of which gender suffers the brunt of the direct pain.  This is exactly the argument that drew me to feminism in the first place.  Men suffer from women being discriminated against, and vice versa.  Where I depart from feminism (recently) is when it focuses solely on women, which can\\'t work because men and women are inextricably linked (beyond the fact that we share a planet).\\n\\nI think this topic is best demonstrated through shared child care, specifically in Sweden :\\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/07/economist-explains-15\\n\\nSwedes are considered to be progressive with gender equality issues, but this balance between men and women with parental leave took a while to get right.  The initial solution (giving parents a shared pool of time off) ended up with women still at a career disadvantage because mostly women took leave.  Now, they enforce that part of each pool is dedicated to each parent.  This has removed some of the perception that women would be the primary care taker and thus less available to work (one of the many classical arguments used against women relating to pregnancy).\\n\\nTo contrast, by focusing solely on women, we end up with solutions that are less beneficial to both groups, and society at large (the same is true with men).  Saying that we\\'re just going to give women more maternity leave still puts a woman at a disadvantage, despite the fact that this seems like a benefit.  It seemed counter-intuitive to me at first, but I find it to be true that you can\\'t focus on one group in isolation.\\n\\nI think it\\'s important to talk about history (patriarchy, societal change, etc), but today, right now, we\\'re all in the same boat.  Women and men oppress/hurt other men and women (replace men/women with any sub-sections of the population, sexual preferences, race, etc) and we need to work to stop hurt where ever we find it.

But if no one owns slaves, and you are the only one, then I\\'d judge you pretty hard.

Fewer and fewer people are participating in body shaming. That means it\\'s shifting from a societal problem to a personal one.

People were still homophobic, but the attitudes started to shift. \"I\\'m not gay! Not that there\\'s anything wrong with it.\" Then in the 2000\\'s it shifted further.

People haven't gone from being horrible to homosexuals to being nice to them because they themselves have become tolerant and compassionate but because they've been conditioned to believe that homosexuality is at least value neutral and more importantly that to express negative views about homosexuality is itself a moral shortcoming and that anyone who does that should be shunned and stigmatised in the way that homosexuals were previously. \\n\\nI would say that your example is pretty illustrative of what the OP means. You're talking about the way society conditions our expression while OP is talking about our fundamental motivation for expressing ourselves. If anything I think people are actually getting worse in that respect,  becoming more snarky and angry because of all the online conflict and petty agitation by political interests. \\n\\nAlso your slavery comparison is fundamentally flawed because slave owning confers competitive advantage,  it's a collective action problem at heart.  \",\n",

You're saying 'no, it's social conditioning'. What I'm saying is that it's both, the meanness comes from you but social conditioning affects how you express it. The example you give only shows a shift in a social conditioning, not a shift in people's motives or personality. I'm saying that people are just as immature, snarky, intolerant, egotistical etc. (in fact I think it's become worse because of the internet) only they're conditioned to express it differently. I'm not saying they're suppressing beliefs about homosexuality, only that the character flaws that made them nasty to homosexuals are channelled into different areas because homosexuality has shifted in meaning for them. Whatever has replaced homosexuals as the group to be looked down on is still treated with disdain, self-righteous repugnance etc. \\n\\nMy point is that there isn't a change in the people,  there is a rechannelling of their personalities.\\n\\nOP is talking about that deeper level, about actual tolerance, compassion etc. as personality traits. Support for homosexuality isn't tolerance, (even though the word gets used in political ideas around the subject) because by definition you don't tolerate something that you believe is OK. And believing something is OK doesn't demonstrate a tolerant or compassionate personality, it just demonstrates a belief. \\n\\nEven believing that tolerance and compassion are virtuous traits doesn't indicate that someone actually has those traits. \",\n",

They thought they were helping them by telling them to choose to get married to a person of the opposite sex and have children instead of chasing random sex with the same gender. The same applies to people who body shame. They are trying to be nice by telling fat people to lose weight and become healthier. They think that rejecting homosexuality and body shaming people actually helps the person. They are doing it out of love, not out of hate. The change is that people are now realizing their attempts to help are actually hurting people.\\n\\nSome people are just plain mean and body shame because of their own negative personality traits. But most people are nice people who think they are doing the right thing. This idea of the \"right thing\" is guided by societal standards of morality and beauty.\\n\\nSo I agree with your views for small number of genuinely mean people. But I don\\'t think that encompasses more than 10% of the population. Body shaming doesn\\'t just happen in that 10%. It mostly happens because of that 90%.

The result is obesity.  \\n\\nYou bring up a good question concerning health vs aesthetic as motivation.  Are \"smoking stinks\" and \"obesity is ugly\" health related or aesthetic?',\n",

Somehow smoker shaming has become more acceptable, and body shaming has become less acceptable. It's not about negative personality traits in individuals. It's about many well meaning people changing their opinion of what is right and wrong. That's why I disagree with the OP's view.\\n\\nAs another way of putting it, you can frame smoker shaming as a morally right thing to do. That would mean that smoker shaming is a positive personality trait, even though the person doing it is just as mean as someone who fat shames. This is why I think this is a subjective societal idea.

       "   'If this was any other industry emotion may not be the primary cause, but the news media is designed to be sensationalized and emotional in every way The main reason child gender count isn\\'t normally included is because with regards to children people are generally just as emotionally stirred regardless of gender. If someone said \"Pedophile rapes 5 little boys, and 5 little girls!!!\" that would be considered just as atrocious by our subconscious as 10 little girls or 10 little boys. People only begin to classify the crimes against a female as worse than crimes against a male when they are old enough to differentiate by sex, or in other words after puberty. This is because of differences between women and men after puberty, where as in children there is no real difference between genders except for genitalia, and that is when we are old enough to be grouped into cultural expectations such as: women are helpless, men aren\\'t helpless. This leads us to subconsciously think \"those helpless women.\" while thinking \"I wish one of those men could have stopped it, sucks they died, but oh well they should have tried harder.\" Also this tends not to be a journalist problem as much as producers thinking, \"How can I make this story more sensational while still retaining its credibility?\" When a story is sensationalized it is rarely the journalists doing. It is a well known fact that, in the USA at least can\\'t speak for other countries, media is incredibly sensationalized with easily identified traits \"BREAKING NEWS!!!!\" (which I highly doubt is journalists doing) and not so easily identified traits \"Latino man kills Caucasian teenage girl.\" which is manipulating ingrained prejudices that we as individuals hold because of our culture. The problem with trait two is that it uses less noticeable signals because the information looks relevant, but why is the race of a victim relevant, and why is the gender relevant? Sometimes race and gender are mentioned purely because it adds to how much we can relate to a situation. Saying \"A person was killed in Orlando today by being beaten to death by an unidentified suspect thought to be in a relationship with the victim. \" just doesn\\'t hold the same emotional value as \"A Caucasian woman was killed in Orlando today by being beaten to death by an unidentified African-American male thought to be her boyfriend.\" Again we relate because of small ingrained subconscious beliefs that we have no ability to change because our culture gave them to us.

       "  'comments': ['If you want to make comparisons between cricket and baseball (which makes sense, they\\'re superficially quite similar), let\\'s go.  Ways in which cricket is a more difficult sport to play than baseball:\\n\\n1. Batting duration.  In baseball, a batter will face, what, a dozen pitches in a game? Maybe two dozen?  In cricket, a good innings will consist of the batter spending 4 or more consecutive hours (sometimes at many as 12 hours (spanning over two days)) at the crease, facing 200+ deliveries.  This level of concentration, endurance and repetition is far beyond anything in baseball and, within that period of batting, they are required to run up and down the length of the pitch dozens of times, much unlike baseball.  The endurance and concentration in cricket really are far beyond baseball.\\n\\n2. Batting difficulties.  As well as the length of time, and number of deliveries faced, the batsmen must deal with factors that make baseball look like a child\\'s game.  A bouncing ball makes it very difficult to determine where the ball is going, as it can bounce in wildly varying directions.  This is in addition to the considerable swing that can be achieved by the bowlers (similar to baseball pitchers).  \\nOn top of this, ricket batsmen have to expect a ball that can be coming to their left side or their right side, and can be coming as a full-toss or a yorker (bouncing right at their feet) or a \"length delivery\" (bouncing a few feet before the batsman) or a bouncer (which can bounce up as high as shoulder height).  By comparison, baseball batter\\'s have a very small \"strike zone\", which is on their dominant side, at very convenient heights to allow for best strike.  \\nFinally, the fastest baseball pitches are slightly faster than cricket bowlers can achieve (due to the required bowling action), but the difference is fairly minimal.\\n\\n3. Baseball fielders get whopping big gloves with which to field/catch.  Once again, this is child\\'s play to a cricketer, who must field and catch bare-handed, thus requiring much greater skill.\\n\\n4. Bowlers (cricket) are often required to bowl for long spells at a time - this means they\\'re bowling 50% of the balls for a period of time that can last much longer than half an hour (each delivery often including a pretty long run-up).  These bowlers are often required to then bat for as long as possible a couple of hours later, or later the same day.  \\nThis probably isn\\'t ***more*** difficult than baseball pitching, but it\\'s at least comparable.\\n\\nThere are several more, but this reply is getting too long.\\n\\n---\\n***TL;DR*** The sheer length of batting innings, and the difficulties of facing each delivery require endurance and concentration that put cricket out of the league of baseball.  Add to this the fact that bowling is at least as strenuous as pitching, and fielding is noticeably more difficult, I think it\\'s probably demonstrable that baseball is the easier of the two sports.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s not even comparing it to other sports.',\n",

This is because, although hitting the wickets is a way to get the batsman out, bowling straight at the wickets is also predictable and easy for the batsman to score from.  Instead, bowlers tend to prefer to bowl on the \"off-side\", which makes scoring harder and increases the likelihood of being caught.  \\nThis (from what I understand of baseball) contrasts baseball pitchers, because the job of the pitcher is to get a strike every ball.

I don\\'t stress about my exams, because I know I\\'m ready for them.\\n\\n&gt; Comprehensive exams are also ineffective as a means to show the professor how much the students have learned. Like I mentioned before, many students cram before exams, which is a useless tactic for long-term retention. \\n\\nBy the same logic, ANY exam or test is useless to prove long-term retention; any fact can be forgotten after being written, whether for a one-question quiz or a day-long exam.\\n\\n&gt; I cram. My friends complain about it. I have rarely heard someone say \"I\\'ve been preparing for this test for a month!\"\\n\\nThat\\'s also not the fault of the test. Maybe the person who has prepared for a month isn\\'t talking about it because they are ready; they feel no stress, so the test doesn\\'t rest on their minds long enough to become conversation.\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s also pertinent to note, at least in my experience, that review materials are handed out generally about a week before the final begins, after the class has been taught the last unit of material. A week to review an entire course of material is still a relatively short amount of time.\\n\\nIf you\\'re waiting for a piece of paper to tell you what to review, you may have other alternatives. Look at past exams, ask others who have taken the course before, review the material for what seems most important, ask the instructor for more guidance or to release this material sooner, etc.\\n\\n&gt; A better approach to testing would be to hand out small quizzes every day, and have unit tests, instead of holding comprehensive exams.\\n\\nI think they BOTH have value.

       "   \"My OP addressed both of these points. \\n\\n&gt;Elizabeth takes Booker back to the point where he would make all of his choices. \\n\\nBooker being brought into a different timeline does not make him the Booker of that timeline. If it did then when you first enter Columbia you would become Comstock, who is the Booker of that timeline. \\n\\n&gt;At this point there are no other choices. The idea is that if that Booker dies there would be no more options to branch out. Everything would stop there. Nothing else would have the option to branch.\\n\\nThis is simply not how the multiple universes explained in the game work. Look at it like this. Under your proposition there is one singular timeline up until the point Booker makes the decision to be baptized or not and then all other universes split of as a part of that decision. If that was how it worked then that single decision would only make 2 universes, one with Booker and one with Comstock, and therefore Elizabeth could just wait and kill the Booker that chooses the baptism. \\n\\nInstead it works like this. Every choice anyone ever makes creates an alternate universe. Therefore there are infinite universes before Booker is born. Every choice Booker makes will also create alternate universes so from the second he is born he starts creating alternate universes with every decision. This means that at the time of the baptism there are already millions of other Bookers in other universes which means that at least a few of those Bookers also had to make the decision to get baptized or not. So killing a single Booker in single timeline accomplishes nothing since there are hundreds of other alternate universes where alternate Bookers also had to make the baptism decision and some of those decisions are going to create Comstocks. \\n\\nHere is a simple example. Booker wakes up on the day of the baptism and chooses between wearing black socks or brown socks. This decisions creates splits the timeline, one for each color of socks. So the Booker that choose to wear black socks goes to the baptism and gets killed before he can make the decision. The Booker that choose brown socks goes to the baptism and does't get killed. He then makes the choice between getting baptized or running away. This choice creates more alternate universes, one where he goes on to become Comstock and one where he doesn't. So to kill all of the Bookers Elizabeth is going to have to go the each timeline where there was a Booker who had to make the baptism decisions. \",\n",
       "   \"Booker being baptized is the only variable that matters. Stop that choice from being made and there is no branching. Booker never becomes baptized means there is no option of creating a Comstock. Those potential timelines just become pruned. \\n\\nYou see that when there are multiple E's killing Booker and then they fade to one.\\n\\n\\nChoices of socks don't matter. Any other choices don't matter as long as they happen before baptism. Baptism does. That's the one that causes the split in the first place. That's your variable. \",\n",
       "   \"Why is that the only choice in the entire history of the world that causes the time lines to split?\\n\\nAnd even it it was the only choice that matters, one second after that choice is made there will exist only 2 timelines. One where he made the choice and one where he didn't. If Elizabeth goes to that exact second and kills only the Booker that made the choice to be baptized then that would stop the possibility of ant Comstocks. There is a point in time after Booker has made the decision to be baptised but before he has made any other decisions which could cause any more timeline splits. As long as E kills him in that moment it would stop all Comstocks but allow the other Booker to live. \\n\\nBut even then it doesn't matter because the Booker you are playing as has already made that decision and therefore there is no reason to kill him. He would have to watch as Elizabeth killed the younger version of himself at the baptism for her plan to make any sense. \",\n",

I've said what I'm going to say. \",\n",
       "   '&gt; I so simply know that once you kill him there is zero chance of a bunch of timelines branching out. \\n\\nIf Booker categorically dies before the choice of the Baptism, then there are no timelines which contain Columbia, and hence no Bioshock Infinite (this is already logically troubling, since you need Bioshock Infinite to prevent the events of Bioshock infinite, but I will pass on this). However, this does *not* prevent branching timelines in a global sense because the game justifies it with pseudoscientific interpretations of the many world\\'s interpretation of quantum physics. I won\\'t let that one go, so first of all:\\n\\nThere never was a \"prime\" or \"original\" or whatever Booker. If there are branching paths because physics, and they can be created parallel to human narrative (the *premise* of the game), then that means the events in Booker\\'s life leading up to the Baptism happened \"a million million times\", with \"a million million\" variations. Every choice anyone made ever during his life, down to what to do for lunch that day creates an untold number of Bookers, some of which are headed to Baptism (and will make the Choice^TM there) and an untold number that die or otherwise pass up the Baptism entirely. You *have* to accept this, because they are acting as this is science- at least science of their world.\\n\\nEven still, taking *this* Booker\\'s life is meaningless. He 100% cannot become Comstock, while a \"million million\" others will. Furthermore, that any Comstock exists at all in the multiverse is a definitive problem (at least Elizabeth believes so- one Comstock would reach beyond \"his\" universe and so none can remain- this itself is seriously flawed logic from the game but that\\'s another issue).\\n\\nThe problem comes down to the game trying to hedge in authority/believability with physics, but only sometimes. Even moreso, if you want to plead special circumstances and \"only the Baptism\" can create branching worlds, well, then you\\'d be wrong. We have at least three specific Bookers, all with different paths, and presumable four worlds off the top of my head that I can recall:\\n\\nThe Bookers:\\n\\n- You\\n- The Comstock you kill\\n- The Booker that dies in the Revolutionary World.\\n\\nThe Worlds:\\n\\n- Detective Booker is unbaptised (the player-character\\'s origin)\\n- Booker becomes Comstock (the first setting)\\n- The Bloody Revolution (revolutionaries are more violent and successful)\\n- The Elizabethian Invasion (when an older Elizabeth shows you the destruction she wrought after being successfully indoctrinated, so this can\\'t be your Elizabeth, nor could it be the a result from the Bloody Revolution, since Comstock loses there- hell this suggests a second Comstock- four Bookers now).',\n",

Personally, I think a more likely explanation is that the distribution of women has \"fatter tails\" than the distribution of men. If we\\'re comparing a bell curve of the number of sexual partners men have with a bell curve of the number of sexual partners women have, I think the male curve has a higher peak at the middle (more men with a moderate number of sexual partners) and is more steeply sloped than the female curve.

       "  'comments': [\"Hello. I believe there are a few things that should probably cleared up in order to be able to come to a reasoned conclusion.\\n\\nFirstly, there seems to be an assumption that a moral choice must of necessity place the agent of that choice at a great disadvantage, and even place them, or those that depend on them, in a fatal position. What is closer to the truth is that morality, and moral choice itself, pervades everyday interactions. OP seems to be using 'choice' and 'morality' as monumental categories, whereas in reality every completed action to which there was an alternative is a product of choice, and a choice in which there are other people to consider is to a greater or lesser extent a moral choice. \\n\\nSecondly, it would be good to at least slightly clear up what is meant by 'moral' and 'morality'. To keep it short, I'll say morality in this circumstance is a set of principles distinguishing between 'good' and 'bad' actions within a social sphere. i.e. concerning and/or involving ones self and others. 'Moral' is that which partakes in the principles of morality. Also, I'll assume in this circumstance that  what is moral and what is immoral could be generally agreed upon by those involved. \\n\\nNow, the presumption that OP seems to be working on is that conditions wherein people simply cannot act unselfishly and morally in order to survive are the standard in many places and situations around the world. I would say that these situations are quite the opposite; they are aberrations in the regular flow of life, even in those places where resources are scarce, and threat of violence is high. Because moral choice isn't just a monumental category comprised of life or death situations, but also comprises much of everyday interaction, my argument would be that the ability to act morally, and to make moral choices benefits everyone. I'd venture to say that it is even more vital for those living in scarcity to make moral decisions, than it is for people living in luxury.\\n\\nMy reasoning is this. The examples that seem to come up often feature people in extreme or exacerbated positions, and whilst those are situations wherein morality features strongly, they are only the meeting-points of a complex web of circumstances which inform the choices of those involved. Creating a favourable web of circumstance, one which would allow the agent to not have to resort to immoral behaviour, is in itself a moral process. This involves using the faculties OP outlined (charity, forgiveness, love to strangers), and many more. Things like paying for what you buy, greeting others, looking after the neighbour's pet, letting people borrow things, all these are to a certain extent moral actions that build a sense of safety and community. These actions scale up and down in magnitude, but they each contribute something to the web of circumstance we live in as social beings. They build positive connections to others so that we can endure through the worse times as well as the good. This is why I would say moral actions are not just possible, but even more necessary for people living in scarcity than in luxury. In times when you cannot rely on impersonal and passive agreements with states or organisations for safety and subsistence, it is necessary to be able to rely on a network built up of people whom you are more likely able to trust because of your prior engagements with them. This is impossible if all you do, and all you can expect others to do, is to act selfishly and immorally. Of course, sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes the situation is incomprehensibly extreme to the extent that people just don't function beyond knee-jerk reactions, or in states of near-trance, but those are not common enough to make moral choice a product of comfort.\\n\\nI'd go into examples, but I believe this is already too long, and no-one will read it.\\n\\nTL;DR-  Morality and moral choice builds up a web of support and connection, wherein survival is not less but more likely.\"]},\n",

There are traits that change value across brains, and some have a slightly higher prevalence in one or the other, but the Venn Diagram is a circle with two thumbnails on the ends, not a pair of binoculars. \\n\\nTo put a fine point on it, it's not possible to determine the gender of a brain from gross anatomy.

Most of us actually want to to have lots of time for leisure. Some of us are able to have several hours of leisure time per day, even on days we work, while others may barely have an hour of leisure time before they need to rest for eight hours before restarting the next day.

On a broader scale, a political leader may have to decide whether to raise taxes on the rich without perfect knowledge of all the economic consequences of that decision.\\n\\nIn making such decisions, it is necessary to have a picture of the world, an idea of how to think, an idea of what it is and is not moral to do, an idea of what a just society looks like, and so forth.

Now, it is false that people are inherently selfish, so the particular generalization he is basing his defection on is mistaken, but the policy that he is following of basing his decisions on evidence is a good policy.\\n\\nContrast that with the person who defects without giving an empirical claim that they are basing their defection on.

At the moment we are very much living in a time where it may seem like women get whatever they want, and it\\'s mostly because women in general have more to want. \\n\\n&gt; for example circa the 1920s, women wanted to vote, of course they had no need for it, they stayed at home raising the children on average\\n\\nOne major catalyst for women\\'s suffrage was a desire to ban alcohol. This was because drinking was more prevalent back then and men would often get drunk and terrorize his wife and children. (which was normal so calling the police wasn\\'t a sure way to get the violence to stop) It very much mattered to them who was representing their husbands because they were the only ones that had enough power to stop them. Having the right to vote would\\'ve been the only way to fix that problem, one only a woman would\\'ve have a want to advocate for. \\n\\n&gt; it wasn\\'t until the 1960\\'s that all men regardless ownership or business status, got the vote, and they had to sell the state their body in the form of the draft for the very same right women got 40 years prior, completely for free.\\n\\nIt makes sense to send the men to war during a draft, after all the consensus had been that a woman\\'s place was in the home so what sense would it have made to take her out of it? Equality of the sexes hadn\\'t even been a thing yet so to argue that it was unfair is matter of fact on many different levels. \\n\\nBut back to what I was saying earlier; women seem to get everything they want because they have more *to* want. We want equal pay because we currently don\\'t have it, something men don\\'t have to worry about at all. We want abortion rights because even in my own home state of Texas the governor has more say over what happens in my own body than I do, also something a man never has to worry about. \\n\\nThink about it this way: Men will often say that businesses cater more towards women and that it\\'s unfair. This is true, but only because women require/request more from their local store. Women need tampons and sanitary napkins so there\\'s an aisle for that, an aisle that men have no need for and has no equivalent. Women want to wear makeup so there\\'s an aisle for that too, again one that men don\\'t buy and has no equivalent, because there aren\\'t many items that men normally buy that a woman can\\'t use. And the concept is the same in many other facets of daily life. \\n\\nAs far as DV is concerned IMO this is a product of media. One rule in journalism is that, \"Dog bites man\", isn\\'t a story worth reading. In a way, \"Man beats wife\", can be seen the same way. But, \"Wife beats husband\", is new (as far as news coverage is concerned) and gets more people talking about it. It\\'s a problem, and it\\'s always been a problem for both men and women, it\\'s just that now it\\'s socially acceptable for men to admit to it, and even then only to an extent. \\n\\nOn that note, the idea of newness is exciting. Just recently I read a story about how couples are now wanting girls instead of boys and why there\\'s been a shift in this attitude. One point was because girls can do more, as in a girl can wear a dress *and* take karate, etc. They still love their boys just as much, perhaps it\\'s just that boys/men are both privileged and persecuted when it comes to what society demands of them.\\n']},\n",

In fact, it\\'s arguable that the DEA overruled their own administrative judge to place MDMA in schedule I rather than Schedule III, so as to prevent further research on it from being conducted. \\n\\n&gt; Of course, even if we lower these barriers so that scientists are less restricted in studying recreational drugs, there is still a limited pool of publically available money for the research. I assume that most of it would come from NDIA since they already fund research on illegal drugs. But creating a new drug and testing it in a scientifically rigorous way is going to be pretty expensive. So the options for funding seem to be 1.) use the small amount of federal research money available and have slow progress 2.) get some extremely wealthy private benefactors or 3.) let someone monetize this research in some way, presumably by selling recreational drugs.\\n\\nYes, If recreational use and sale of drugs was allowed, there would be financial incentive for companies to research recreational drugs. \\n\\n&gt; Are you also arguing that these (presumably safer) drugs should then be legalized? If so, how safe should recreational drugs be in order to be legal? Should they be safer than alcohol, in terms of addictive potential, toxicity, long-term health effects, and potential harm from impaired people to society? Or just safe enough? Or should all drugs be legalized regardless of harm, including some drugs that are incredibly harmful, as long as people understand what the dangers of these drugs are?\\n\\nI think that most drugs should be legal, but probably not all. I believed if you engineered drugs to be both safer and more pleasurable, I think that people would generally opt to take those drugs instead. Obviously there will be some people who will only want to do \"classic\" drugs, but it\\'s not exactly like we are stopping them now anyway. \\n\\nIf you\\'re bar for safety is alcohol, then I think you have a good argument for legalizing the majority of drugs anyway. But I don\\'t think that\\'s a good metric. If I had to decide, I would look at each individual drug, and ask, \"would making this drug available for recreational use have a net positive, or net negative effect on society?\" I think that drugs like Heroin, LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, mescaline, DMT, THC are great candidates for legalization, because they are not particularly physical harmful, and the harms and expenses caused prohibition greatly outweigh any negative effects of the drugs themselves.\\n\\nDrugs like Cocaine, amphetamine, ketamine, alcohol and tobacco are not as clear cut, but I still think that the social costs of their prohibition would outweigh any damage that they cause. I think this is the best category for which finding safer substitutions would be very worthwhile.\\n\\nMethamphetamine, PCP, designer stimulants, and synthetic canabinoids, I\\'m not so sure about. These are the drugs that can really fuck you up regardless of purity and harm reduction. While I don\\'t think that prohibition has been effective at suppressing the use of these drugs, I\\'m far less comfortable with letting them be readily available. I don\\'t think I know enough to make a decision about what we should do about them.\\n\\nIn my ideal scenario that will never happen, you could go to a medical professional and ask for a recreational prescription. They will tell you about the nature of the drug and its effects, negative effects and risks, and general harm reduction methods, as well as possibly safer alternatives, pharmaceutical or otherwise. I\\'m not saying that\\'s the only solution, but it makes the most sense to me.\\n\\nI also think it\\'s important to note that there is no real solid evidence that legalization would increase use. Many people like to make this assumption, but if you look at countries that have decriminalized drugs, you haven\\'t seen increase in use or addiction. Obviously decriminalization and legalization are not the same, but I still don\\'t think it\\'s a fair assumption to make. ']},\n",
