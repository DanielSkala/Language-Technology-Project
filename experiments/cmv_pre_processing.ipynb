What you do with it is what matters. It\\'s like anything else. You can use it to build or to destroy. You just have to make the choice.\"\\n\\nConstructive anger,\" the demon said, her voice dripping sarcasm. \\n\\nAlso known as passion,\" I said quietly. \"Passion has overthrown tyrants and freed prisoners and slaves. Passion has brought justice where there was savagery. Passion has created freedom where there was nothing but fear. Passion has helped souls rise from the ashes of their horrible lives and build something better, stronger, more beautiful.\"\\n\\nThink about people like Oskar Schindler and MLK. They saw great injustices and were angered by them. But instead of turning their anger outward and hurting people they turned it inward and used it as fuel to make the world a better place.',\n",
